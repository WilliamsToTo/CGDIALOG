This repository contains the dataset and the pytorch implementations of the models from the paper [Less is More: Mitigate Spurious Correlations for Open-Domain Dialogue Response Generation Models by Causal Discovery]().

## Dataset

### Data Format

## Setup:
The code is based on PyTorch and HuggingFace `transformers`.
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## How to use our models
You can download our models, then put to `models` folder:
- [ESConv_classifier]()
- [MSC_classifier]()
- [ESConv_generator]()
- [MSC_generator]()


### Generate responses
```bash
python 
```
