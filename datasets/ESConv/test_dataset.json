As time went on, I did not know what went wrong but he started showing disinterest in matters that concerns me . When it started we had the conversation. I was worried and he assured me nothing was wrong. I later found out with a great dismay that he was going out with one of our high school acquaintances . It really hurt the more when he told me  what I thought we had was over. it shattered me emotional. He went from avoiding my calls to not wanting to see me around. it hurts  me badly.
