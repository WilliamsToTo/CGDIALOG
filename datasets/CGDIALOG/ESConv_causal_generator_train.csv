People in my church have been bringing me food.  I plan on trying to go to the food bank Monday, if they are open.	I hope that they can help you. My partner and I have used one before and they were very helpful. I felt a bit ashamed but there was no judgement at all.
I have been very fortunate.  People in my church have been bringing me food.  I plan on trying to go to the food bank Monday, if they are open. </s> <s> I actually got so tired of redialing the Department of Labor and Training that I sent an email to the Lieutenant Governor of the state asking for his assistance in getting the matter resolved.	That sounds like a very positive thing to have done. I really hope that they pay some attention to you. This situation is not your fault!
I have been very fortunate.  People in my church have been bringing me food.  I plan on trying to go to the food bank Monday, if they are open. </s> <s> I have been to this food bank once before, and they actually made me feel very comfortable and welcomed and gave me an information package on other ways the parent organization may be able to assist me.	Yes they are run by lovely people. Ours gave us a pamphlet for cheap and easy to make recipes too.
I have been very fortunate.  People in my church have been bringing me food.

Although he can not legally fire me for being ill with COVID, he can take me back and simply release me the same day saying that I have become redundant."	That would be incredibly immoral of him. Do you feel that he is likely to do such a  thing?

But I have taken the attitude that if it does occur, there is nothing I can do to change the situation.  I would simply pursue a charge against him for wrongful termination, and seek a new job.	That is a very rational way to look at things. I really hope that it does not come to thank though! Thank you for talking and I wish you all the best for the coming months.
I may not win the suit, but I would definitely file one.  In 2000, I had an employer fire me without cause.  I sued and won that time.  Not only did they have to pay me back wages for the 90 days that the investigation took place, which was no minor sum, </s> <s> they were found to be guilty, so the judge granted me my wages based on the average of 80 hour weeks I had been working, all my vacation time, plus the overtime I would have received, holiday pay, and then to put a nice bow on that gift, he awarded me 5000 dollars in damages because the old company lied and said I had broken the law.

"Yeah, it's pretty cool.  For example, if I hit DRAT in one stroke, then ""Did there come a time"" will appear in English on my machine's  LCD screen. </s> <s> Each stenographer has their own ""Personal Dictionary"" which is a list of words in English along with how you in particular write out those words or phrases in steno.  This dictionary is present within the actual steno machine after you transfer it from your laptop to the machine via cable or wifi.  Thus your machine then knows how you write out words in particular and how to translate those words from steno to English - each stenographer writes a little differently."	OK that makes sense, so you basically program it as the user. I take it your stenography machine becomes pretty close to you lol

My ex partner and I broke up a long time ago because they cheated on me. Now they will not stop contacting my friends and family and posting about me on social media </s> <s> I have tried but everyone just tells me there is nothing they can do because they don't think it is dangerous or criminal at this point	That must be very frustrating. Can you tell me if you’ve tried other things to get them to stop?
It sounds like you are avoiding things you enjoy because of their actions. I think documenting it is a good idea! Have you tried reporting them for harassing you? </s> <s> I have confronted them in person but it was dramatic to say the least. They basically had a meltdown that they don't want to lose me	You tried to do the right thing and they are having a difficult time letting go. The ongoing comments through social media sounds like they are wanting your attention. That can be exhausting for you. In my past, I had to block someone who did something similar to me. If my friends mentioned seeing something from my ex about me, I asked them to keep it to themselves or consider blocking them,too. The people who were closest to me understood what was going on and I realized that people who didn’t know me, didn’t matter. Would you be willing to suggest this to friends or family if it would help to remove the ex from your interactions?

I have encouraged my friends to block them as well, but a new account always pops up. My ex really will not give up. </s> <s> It has been happening for at least 6 months now and it usually happens every weekend	I can sense your frustration. It must be overwhelming at times and make you dread the weekends. It sounds like it has become a habit for your ex. It might help if you write a letter to them explaining that you are ready to move on and are asking them to do the same. Explain that you are giving them the opportunity to stop harassing you in the following ways [list some of the details you have documented]. Inform them that if they do not stop, you are considering taking it further regarding harassing communications and that this letter serves as your intention to no longer tolerate their actions. Send it via certified mail and keep a copy. This will give them no way to immediately respond and would be the first step of official documentation should they decide to continue.  Do you think that might help?

There are a few online tutors but they are almost always busy </s> <s> No, none of my friends are taking the class/ none of them have ever taken calculus	There seem to be some really good online courses out there.

During a time like this, some people find it helpful to keep busy doing some kind of activity to take their mind off of their pain.

That is a very long time, I had a girlfriend and I was very vested in her and her family. She broke up with me around Christmas time as well.

If you do not feel comfortable, then you do not feel comfortable and should not be shamed for it.

Yes, I have a lot of exams right now and that on top of not hanging out with friends a lot lately has made life tough. </s> <s> I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot	Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that.
Yes, I think you have excellent advice about organization. I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best? </s> <s> I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating.	Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule.
For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense. </s> <s> Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school.	Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal.
Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments. </s> <s> I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe.	Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books.
Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that. </s> <s> I have 6 classes	That's a lot but it is totally doable. Here is a good example, If you plant seeds in a garden today, you have to weed it a bit tomorrow, the next day, the next day, you have to wait for rain, then weed some more, the harvest comes and YAY! You are happy. But if you lie on your bed, never planting, never weeding, you procrastinate, you get nothing.
Yes haha. That is a good comparison. You have been super helpful. I will for sure try to use your advice. Thank you! </s> <s> Have a great day and thanks again	You are quite welcome! God bless have a great day!
I'm having trouble getting motivated to finish my senior thesis </s> <s> In about a month.	I'm sure you will be able to finish it, sometimes we find ourselves in a slump and need some fresh air blown our way.
Whenever I have a large project and lose motivation, I set my goals on paper, then break it down into smaller bites. For example, I will make sure I work one hour on certain days, or call a friend, I generate ideas to keep me on track. </s> <s> My other problem is that I'm a perfectionist. I tend to over-analyze and get bogged down, especially when doing research.	Another idea is rewards, when you finish one goal, perhaps put a reward for yourself,  a yogurt with sprinkles or something like that
That is why a time line is good. For example, you make a goal that you will work on your reference and citation page for one hour, after that, you are DONE, If you have time at the end, you can revisit it. The hour is my suggestion, you make your own. lol THAT way, you don't get caught going on and on for 6 hours to make it perfect. One hour is reasonable. </s> <s> That definitely sounds reasonable. Putting micro deadlines in might be what I need to do to keep me focused.	I do this with EVERYTHING in life because I tend to go on and on too focused and lose track of everything. lol For example, I clean each room for 15 minutes a week. If it needs more, I do more, but I set the timer and you would be surprised how well that works, otherwise, I will spend all my time perfecting one room and the rest is a mess.

But so far away.	My Graduation Day was amazing.  This is what life is about, working NOW for rewards later. It's like a garden, you sow, you weed, you wait for rain and weed some more. You keep waiting and weeding, then later harvest come. It takes time to work a little each day, then time passes whether you lay on your bed or whether you are in the garden working. If you lay on your bed, you get nothing, if you work a little every day, in time, you reap rewards.

Not much in life is easy or free, if we keep working little by little, as time passes, you real a lot of rewards, in fact, you will reap rewards of finishing this thesis for YEARS even decades. It is a great goal and a worthy one to keep at.

That is always a tough one. My suggestion is to not put him in a bad light since they do not have the angry feelings toward him that you do.

Right, it can seem a bit confusing since you naturally would expect to feel comfortable with so much between each other already.
Right, and there are endless possibilites the mind can create outside of ideal.

I don't think I can last another semester teaching myself from home. </s> <s> Yes, I was always an honors student so this is a huge change for me.   I'm afraid it will reflect on my GPA forever.	I know that the situation with virtual learning is out of your control when it comes to how long it will last but is there anything you could do to relieve your stress while you are trying to learn things yourself?

It hasn't really helped because the time I spend exercising I just think I could be studying.	When you start feeling stressed maybe you could try deep breathing for a few minutes to relax again.

I've been remote working for the entire pandemic. At first, it was great. I didn't go into the office very often before, so I felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so. But now I wonder if I am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction. </s> <s> Yes. I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online. But when I interact in person, we share so more - body language, facial expressions, we don't have as much of a time constraint. I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions.	Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress.
I would personally suggest more happy hours, in case you haven't already done so. </s> <s> Ah, something more casual?	Holiday care packages would also be a good common ground for folks to gather around over something that is not work.
So, perhaps limiting meeting times can help the team focus on issues? </s> <s> That's a great idea! I would love to get a care package, actually!	Yeah maybe also virtual meditation sessions can help concentration mind and body. It doesn't have to be hobbies of our own, but doing it as a team virtually can bring people together and boost morale.
Thank you! I will suggest that my organization arrange these. We can even ask all the employees to showcase their hobbies, or some such. </s> <s> I will pass these suggestions on! Have a great holiday season!	That is good to hear. I am aware that the other team in my company all read a book called How to Be Antiracist. It can serve as both learning and bonding purposes.

Yes, I have a lot of coursework but I have no help from from my advisors. A few of my peers feel the same way. Not sure what to do.

Do you think that outlining a plan of action, and sharing that with your family will help turn this around a bit? Perhaps, think about as looking forward to a better opportunity in your future?

"somehow ending up with her getting herself hospitalized 2 weeks later 
for low hemoglobin. </s> <s> I don't know how she is just getting the consequences
 of that now"	A good first step is taking her to your local mental health provider. Or ask at a major emergency room where this is located as sometimes the places are hard to find.
Sometimes it is for the best to set clear boundries. </s> <s> Well I do feel better. Thinking about boundaries. It has been less stressful being so involved.	Without treatment she may just be getting worse.
"Only reason she has a house is because I helped. And if I leave it. Everyone in my family said I would be irresponsible
 to let my mom lose it. </s> <s> Saying my mom has no one and I would regret it if she just does something crazy"	That does make it difficult when a partner encourages you to engage in unhealthy behavior.
My girlfriend just won't let me stay out of it </s> <s> Yeah. If it was up to me I would probably just be dead silent	I suggest talking to your girlfriend about how it makes you feel when she insists you continue a relationship that causes so much pain.

I've heard that meditation can help with stress and focus, maybe you could try meditating for a bit before you study? </s> <s> I have never tried meditating before, I have no idea where to start.

Yeah I understand what you're going through. I was in a similar position not too long ago. I had a hard time wrapping my head around how fast my ex could move on from what we had. How does it make you feel that he's trying to start a new relationship so soon after yours?
He started dating a few months after we split up. I don't know if this is the only person he's dated but I think so. He really moved on quick. </s> <s> It makes me feel like he didn't learn anything from our relationship or like he thinks he's better than me because he has someone new and I don't. I'm trying to take some time and be alone and be okay with being alone, which is good I think, but sometimes I feel really really lonely too. Like maybe I won't ever find anyone.	That must feel really isolating. But working on yourself and becoming a better you is the only way to move on in a healthy manner. I think you're doing the right thing in waiting and learning to love yourself before you can open up and love another.

Exactly. But it is scary.

I want to be in the program, it's just that I feel like everyone is so much smarter than me and my performance in that class makes me question my admission into the programs sometimes. When I feel like this after submitting homework, I end up crying because I just want to do well. I enjoy this field, just not this  class in particular. </s> <s> I'm afraid of failing, but I'm not sure if that should be a concern either. Over the past 3 years, no one has gotten a grade lower than a B.	But do you really think that you would have been admitted to the class if you were not up to the standard?

Most so-called professors are snobs and their TA's are worse. </s> <s> Academia is full of lazy admins and lame teachers.  Plus, the student loan costs are atrocious.	I understand that college can be financially demanding.
Hopefully, my student loans will be forgiven by President Joe Biden in 2021 </s> <s> My anxiety is from the costs of college as well.	You need to think that you will have a secure job once you graduate, and every debt will be eventually paid off even if Biden doesn't forgive it.
Hopefully, my student loans will be forgiven by President Joe Biden in 2021 </s> <s> Yeah, but big debts are big debts	Do you feel better after talking about all of this?
"Try to remain optimistic and shake away the anxiety, it won't do you
 any good. </s> <s> I am still anxious about the end of school"	Not at all, I think what you are experiencing is completely normal, and you just have to cope with it in the most optimistic way possible. Maybe getting your assignments done in time will be helpful for your anxiety. After that, you will have tons of time to spend with friends, family, or simply leisure time to do what you enjoy.

Hello there. In the past 3 years, I have gotten into 2 car accidents. Neither of them were my fault. I sustained a concussion/traumatic brain injury and am experiencing depression and PTSD. </s> <s> I have nightmares of crashing at least 2x a week. I am seeing a therapist, but due to the pandemic we are not meeting in person to do EDMR for my PTSD	Hello, I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds like an awful lot to go through in a few years time, which now can feel like the time passes so quickly.
I have nightmares of crashing at least 2x a week. I am seeing a therapist, but due to the pandemic we are not meeting in person to do EDMR for my PTSD </s> <s> I have a traumatic brain injury that creates a lot of overstimulation in my life.

Have you tried to talk to your therapist through video chat or is that something they offer? </s> <s> Yes, I talk to my therapist every other week	That's great that they can offer that, I know it's very difficult to get regular care at the moment with the pandemic.
I do not have supportive or understanding friends and family </s> <s> Even though neither were my fault, people were not understanding or asked how scary those situations for me were	I am sorry to hear that, people are very quick to judge so it's very unfortunate that you were treated that way.
the car accident was so bad the tow truck guy thought I had died </s> <s> but even after seeing my car, friends and family acted like it was just something that happens to everyone. walk it off	Wow, I can't imagine what the car must have looked like then for such a comment to be made. I'm glad that you here and despite going through that trauma that you are still going.
I do not have supportive or understanding friends and family </s> <s> That sounds scary. And is extremely unfortunate.	I'm sorry that you didn't get the support you needed after your accidents because it's hard enough to go through the pain and trauma (mental and physical) to begin with and the support is much needed.
"Do you have any family or friends close by or something that you can talk to if you feel like you need some extra support? </s> <s> Absolutely! But I'm doing better now. You find out who your real friends and family are and you move on.

Very uncivil method of breaking up.... </s> <s> It just disgusts me how gauche my girl's method was.  Maybe people should be more polite about how they communicate about something like breaking up.	It could be that you are better off without her? If she has such bad manners then I think that you cn do better.

I don't now how to cope with this pandemic any more is getting out of hand </s> <s> Not really but every day ambulance must come to pick one or two because of an emergency	So do you think you can identify the most difficult problem you have? Maybe we can look at that and possible find better ways to cope?
I don't now how to cope with this pandemic any more is getting out of hand </s> <s> I am feeling depression right now	I can understand feeling depressed. I think that can be debilitating at times, however there are ways to cope and help you get out of it.
What is the worst part of it for you? Can you identify that? I'll be honest, my husband and I don't even see anyone dying. </s> <s> I am really afraid here I don't know what to do	As for the pandemic, if you know no one who has died, I wouldn't worry about it. The CDC has no reported deaths of anyone healthy. People who are unhealthy die, not the healthy, and people who are sick ALREADY are the ones who die. If you are relatively healthy, then you are good to go. Do things to protect your health. What are you eating? What are you drinking? Are you talking to friends and getting social life? Are you getting fresh air? Thinking good thoughts?  Or are you living in fear when you are not going to a lot of funerals.
It is well documented that our immune system is affected by our mental state, so it is important that you care for your health. Focusing on the negativity of the pandemic will bring you down. Focusing on being healthy and taking care of your mind, soul, spirit and body will help build up your immunity and make you strong. </s> <s> I don't like the noise of ambulance at all any time I see one I don't feel happy	I can understand an ambulance sound is hard to hear, but even that can be turned around. You can pray for the person, then switch your mind off. If you focus on the negative, you will stay negative. If you do what you can (pray) then there is nothing else to do. Focusing on the negative will depress you.
One thing I did to help with depression is keep a checklist of things to do when I felt down:  call a friend, call a loved one to encourage THEM, go for a walk, eat fruits and veggies, read a book, go for a bike ride, etc.  Things like that, then I chose to do those things despite how I felt. Doing those things helped my mood TREMENDOUSLY> </s> <s> Thanks your words of encouraging help me a lot	I am glad you were able to talk about how this is affecting you. I think many people are affected. And I encourage you to really do things you like and enjoy to keep your mood better. If you feel down, talk about it, pray about it but do NOT dwell on it, because that will bring you down.
Thanks your words of encouraging help me a lot </s> <s> You are very correct I like you a lot	Thank you, how very sweet!  I do thank you for sharing your life with me. I'm an older person and this has affected me too.  Life is full of ups and downs, so I've been through some rough times. You can do this! :D

Pray for the person, pray for the workers. They are the ones who CAN do something about the sick people. You cannot. You didn't become an ambulance worker. I am not an ambulance worker, I cannot help them either, but I can pray God can help them do their job. Then I let it go.

Just taking deep breaths in a quiet area is a great way to clear your head and keep optimistic.
Should I look elsewhere for jobs? </s> <s> I will have to try that.  Maybe it can help me ease my mind.

Even if you chose wrong, you will generally have plenty of time to make up your mind and choose something that you really like : ), plus, you can reach out to academic advisors, for example. </s> <s> but what if that thing is your career choice?	That is a totally normal aspect of human nature. It's normal to get bored of things even if we really liked them at some point

I swear, I can't take these lockdowns anymore. </s> <s> I think that's the other thing that these lockdowns are doing; they're sucking the emotional aspects out of activities and pastimes we love.

It just feels robotic now.	I agree with you, what used to be super-exciting activities now have a much more monotonous feeling.

I worked in manufacturer </s> <s> technical skill in trade school but not degree from college	I see. Would you ideally want to work for a manufacturer company instead of settling down for something temporary while seeking a more matched position?
I see. Would you ideally want to work for a manufacturer company instead of settling down for something temporary while seeking a more matched position? </s> <s> I will seek for another jobs if possible but I can work on manufacturer company too	I understand.

I will seek for another jobs if possible but I can work on manufacturer company too </s> <s> If I can work remotely I will do it.	I have been browsing job boards every now and then.

I was looking for jobs for almost a year. I have a spreadsheet that keeps track of all the jobs I applied. Maybe only 2 or 3 percent of them replied (with an interview request, etc.) I would suggest trying applying for jobs via Linkedin, or google jobs. You can sort them by posted date. My experience is that the more recent the posting date is, the more likely they will review your application.

He always supported them. Just sucks now he is causing so much sadness. </s> <s> He sees me like a son but end of the day. I have to do right by my girlfriend. I love her and her family.	His dementia is causing him to become upset? Your right he does need to be around family and needs love and support, and you are not doing wrong being on your girlfriend side.
Kind of hard when he is the one that owns the houses. Doesn't seem right to leave him.

Is there any way you guys could get a nurse that deals with patients that have dementia to help him out? </s> <s> Well, problem is that he is extremely fit and stubborn. That could be a solution.

I understand. I have also been on edge during these times, one thing I did do is take all the precautions I could to ease my anxiety. </s> <s> Definitely.	One thing I do during my time at home (because we spend so much time at home) is to do yoga. It really helps stabilize my mood and be stress free from the virus. There are several of free Youtube that are amazing!
I am doing well. Thanks for asking. It is really nice outside today. </s> <s> Thank you..	Thank you! Have a great rest of your day.
How did that go? Did everybody feel like they had their voice heard in a cooperative manner? </s> <s> I feel like everyone respected both of our wishes as they were different but everyone also offered advice and shared their experiences. Everyone was cooperative.	So you had a cooperative conversation, but not a very productive one, is that right?

When I worked, I found that smaller problems that wouldn't normally phase me began to have a greater effect when the pandemic hit
you'd be surprised as how much stress actually does to the mind itself. Has anything in your daily life, in the past month alone, changed that would lead to increased stress that you wouldn't normally experience? </s> <s> Honestly I wear a mask 8 hours a day and its not a big deal	Hmm I guess we all deal with the precautionary measure differently.

What industry do you work in? With the pandemic, a lot of interviews are done through Zoom and of course not everyone is at the best through video </s> <s> I work in the hospitality industry, at a hotel.  Trust me I've been looking, but so far no luck. Since this pandemic, I'm not sure I want to leave the house. How have you loved one dealt with it?	That's rough :/ I assist in managing some Airbnb properties and they've been hit so hard because of the pandemic. At least there's a light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccine. Honestly I had one friend who had been looking for a job for over a year and he just got an offer last month. They just kept persevering, even if that included applying to 30+ jobs each week
That's good, at least I know there is light at the end of the tunnel. I was thinking at this stage of the game I might have to learn something new in order to get a job. Hopefully, the vaccine will help start to bring things back to normal. Did your friend find a job in the same field? </s> <s> I sure hope so, fingers crossed. Thankfully, I don't have to work much longer, but since I have been working for so long, I do miss it. I think I miss the people more than anything.

This pandemic has been really rough but I have to keep reminding myself to count myself lucky for staying healthy. I hope you will be safe until the vaccine and after :) I believe in you!
They were starting to feel super down about themselves. I tried my best to support and encourage them not to give up. </s> <s> Awww! Thank you I really needed that, you have no idea how much that means to me. A little encouragement goes a long way in these times we are living in. And you are right, I am healthy and I am thankful for that. Eventually, the job will come.	Yes I think people should be more supportive of each other, especially during these times! Just don't ever give up! I'm really glad that I was able to be of help/support today for you :)
Yes, we do need each other more than we know . I have to remind myself, it's not just me going through this. Thank you for your kind words. </s> <s> I hope you do as well. Stay Healthy and be careful. Thank you again for your kind words. And 2021 will be better than 2020!	Bye! I think you have to end the conversation on your end first.
The ongoing pandemic and my financial situation. I am unemployed and I don't know when I will be able to get a job. </s> <s> I have not been using apps. I use websites and look for jobs there. It is making me feel like I am not qualified enough.	Feelings of insufficiency can be such a stumbling block when looking for work. It is obvious that you are putting forth great effort.
Do you think getting in contact with a job agency in your area would be beneficial to you? </s> <s> I have not contacted a job agency. I don't have experience with them. That is a good idea.	Perhaps there are a few agencies in your area to help and you can maximize your opportunities.

I am unemployed and I don't know when I will be able to get a job. </s> <s> It doesn't help that I live with my parents and because I have no work I spend most of my time at home and get into arguments with them.

I have been better. I had a rough semester in school. </s> <s> It was alright at first but I failed a final that was worth 50% of my grade	I'm sorry to hear that. That's a heck of a situation to be in. Is there anything you can do? Maybe talking to the teacher about some form of extra credit? or is the final grade a lock?
It was alright at first but I failed a final that was worth 50% of my grade </s> <s> Sadly, no. I think they were too busy to really take a long time to discuss it or work with me	Was this for a course that was required for a major?
Yes, I already tried to appeal my grade. </s> <s> It was a core class and I needed it to graduate	Ok, if you're willing to give it one more shot, try to appeal the grade one more time. If that doesn't work, you could try talking the class again next semester or during the summer if it's offered.

Even if he responds negatively, at least you have tried to dissolve the issue once again. In situations like this, remember even when you feel completely alone, that someone is looking out for you even if you do not realize it.

What is your advice from experience with this?	Do you have anyone else to talk to about what you're going through? It also helps a lot of the time to talk to an objective 3rd part to help give you some advice on what they think you should do.
Another thing that might help is focusing on some of your hobbies, I often find it helpful to use my hobbies to get my mind off of things that are bothering me. </s> <s> That is definitely helpful.

That's really great, good for you! </s> <s> I worked for a French company for 8 years, just never really get to pick up until now I am unemployed.	Learning new languages can open up new opportunities for work. It is unique to be bilingual. Make sure to put all your unique attributes, such as learning french, on your resume. It might help!
Are you interested in taking any classes to improve your skillset? There are many free courses available online. </s> <s> Thats a good suggestion, I can't really hold a conversation in French yet.

Maybe it is time for me to start looking elsewhere for better opportunities. I've worked at this place so long that I have become comfortable here and the thought of searching for a new job is intimidating </s> <s> Yeah I agree, it's uncomfortable and difficult though! I haven't searched for a new job in so long, I feel like I will perform terribly at the interviews	Just start slowly and remember that you can be picky about what position you chose. I also think we all feel like we perform badly during interviews. Preparation is key. I hope discussing your work situation today has made you feel a bit better!
Yes - definitely. I am not sure how to proceed or what to do in my situation. I am exhausted, mentally and physically. </s> <s> like generally, or currently in these situations? usually its around 9-5 (give or take).  These days its 9 - 7 or 11pm or later.	I have to say, when I am physically and mentally exhausted, I don't think as clearly and lose hope more easily.
Perhaps - i dont know the solution. the problem is I cannot continue to work these hours - it is just not sustainable. </s> <s> yeah - something like that. and lunches are at the desk - as i am working from home - so its pretty much no breaks either.	I would certainly agree with you. That kind of work is unsustainable. Let me ask you this. What would happen if you told your employer you simply could not do these hours?
The worst that could happen is that they fire you. But that doesn't seem too likely as they seem to need you. But I have learned in life that if I don't care for myself, hardly anyone does. We need to be kind to ourselves. Set boundaries. </s> <s> agreed - i dont think they would fire me, maybe get reprimanded or more likely a guilt trip as to why I cant do it. Im just not sure what kind of boundaries I set when we have things due, and just literally no time.	Setting boundaries can be difficult if you haven't done that a lot. When we think we don't have the ability to say NO, then we feel trapped, worn out, depressed, taken advantage of. People need to know that we reasonably can say no.

Determine how many hours you feel you COULD work. Then advise them that is what you will do. Find out what kind of timelines there are, and if you can't do it, don't go beyond your boundaries. It is obviously destroying your life. It really isn't healthy for you.

I will say a prayer that you communicate your needs politely but firmly. And not believe false guilt. As you said, you aren't putting out fires and doing CPR.

I also talked to a few friends who are married and had experienced infidelity. They chose to forgive each other. I learned a lot from them. It helped me to make up my own mind as to how I needed to move forward. I didn’t want to use a therapist since I do better with discussing ideas with multiple people.
I'm having a hard time being my sons teacher and there is a lot of pressure with that. </s> <s> I've been better. How are you?	I'm better than I deserve. Does teaching your son give you a lot of anxiety?

It is a lot of alien stress to us when, in the past, we were only responsible for ensuring that homework is done.
It's kind of a tired saying, but one strategy that has helped me is the One day at a time strategy. I'm sure you've heard of it. Basically, it means just do for today, don't worry about yesterday, don't stress over tomorrow, just treat this day as it's own task. </s> <s> I've definitely heard that before, but you are completely right.

I end up letting them play video games and with toys in the middle of the day sometimes because I have work that I have to get done as well.

They have to be small, reasonable tasks, but also an amount of time that allows you to take it one bite at a time.

I think you will find that a lot of your friends are in the same place. </s> <s> That is probably true, but everyone has been so busy that I've only really been communicating with my husband.	And that adds to stress beyond the ad-hoc homeschooling. It is important to purposefully socialize by phone or chat with friends. We humans are social creatures, and you are not an island.

I have been in many work situations and even social situations where I did not feel as if I fit in, I'm rather an unusual person. I had to learn to not focus so much on BEING accepted. I had to learn what God think of me (he loves me) and try to be kind to all I meet, other centered. That is, I also had to make sure I wasn't being rude or mean. </s> <s> I think from now on I’m just going to focus on myself and my family, I’m not gonna out of my way to be nice to my coworkers, I’m just going to treat them as coworkers not as friends and just keep to myself	I think you can be kind to them, but I think perhaps your expectations are that they reciprocate, and they aren't which hurts. Perhaps be kind without expecting anything in return, and know that God sees your kindness.

I understand. Yes, then they definitely are taking advantage. Have you read anything on setting boundaries and learning how to say no? </s> <s> Yeah, I’m working on taking care of myself more than worrying about everyone else. I think the holidays make it even harder to set the boundaries	I had learned once that it is so important to be able to easily say no because then we are free to say yes.  Because if we say yes because we CAN'T say no, then we feel resentful. So If I can freely say no to you, then i am free to say yes, if that makes sense.  Although for me, it was hard to say no, but it gets easier, now it is easy. It wasn't at first.
I understand. Yes, then they definitely are taking advantage. Have you read anything on setting boundaries and learning how to say no? </s> <s> Thank you! You have been very helpful. I think that will be my goal! Start learning to say no and don’t feel guilty about it. I think I am going to lower my expectations from other people and just start treating people as they treat me!	If I always say yes, because I can't say no, I feel obligated and resentful, when really, it's me with the problem, I had a hard time saying no because I didn't want to hurt people. Now, I  do the right thing in my heart, if I want to help, I help, if I want to say no, I say no even if it is hard, I don't care if they get upset. I can say no, that's true freedom.

Not too bad outside of work.  I'm miserable there. </s> <s> Things have changed and my new supervisor has crushed my spirit by taking all the parts I love away.  She never liked me and now she gets to make me suffer.	I am very sorry to hear that - trouble with workmates, especially those who are in a higher position, can make things very miserable can't they?
You are right.  She is a bully.  I have called her several names to myself, but not a bully yet.  My coworkers and I have discussed what options we may have.  My suggestion was that we work at our normal pace rather than scrambling to make up for her failures.  I wouldn't want to set her up, but I think her failing is the only way we will ever see a solution. </s> <s> I have applied for another job within my company.  There seems to be interest in me, so that's exciting.  It is a job I really want.  But then, of course, I feel bad about leaving my peers behind.  I really care about them.

But I think I have been giving them good advice about hanging in there, staying positive, etc...  I should probably listen to myself.	(sorry was afk give me a second to catch up :))
You may be right.  My company has an anonymous reporting system.  I should learn a little more about how that works and see if that's an option.  I'm not sure things could get much worse at this point.  This could be my last ditch effort. </s> <s> That's good advice and you saying it directly to me makes me think I should lean into it.  I can't just spin my wheels in misery much longer.	Anonymous reporting sounds like a good thing, as long as it's not being abused. This sounds like a very good time to use it though

You should give them a call. Just out of the blue, nothing commuting. Just a casual chat and see if they want to do something.

Sometimes I have found that running (which I hate doing) makes me feel so much better in times of high stress. Running also releases endorphins into the body which will help to alleviate some of the drinking/stress.

For example. I realized I didn't speak respectfully to him all the time.  So I changed my tone. Sometimes I didn't FEEL respectful, but I read this book explaining how men really need that. So I changed me. And you know what, he really responded well to that. Became more kind and loving. I prayed a lot and that is one thing God showed me. I read a few books on what men were like and how I could help my marriage. My husband often oblivious, but when I worked on me and doing things that men like, he actually became a better man. Hard to explain.
Yes, stress is terrible for chronic illness. I had goals to get back in check with myself, I've been worried about everyone else for so long and not really about me.

I'm so sorry to hear that, that is really rough. He sounds like a real jerk if you ask me! </s> <s> I know he could be at times and he did have a roving eye but I loved him and I miss him a huge amount, despite everything.	I get that, it's hard to understand why the people close to us do bad things.

He sounds like a real jerk if you ask me! </s> <s> I think the biggest problem is that I keep wondering what his new girlfriend is like and if she is prettier or cleverer than me.

Do you really want to be with someone that disregards your well being like that?
I'm so sorry to hear that, that is really rough. He sounds like a real jerk if you ask me! </s> <s> That is a very sensible way to look at things .. I do rationally realise that. Irrationally I just want him to come back to me and say that he made a mistake, though!	I understand, it's easy to get sucked back into the nostalgic good memories of when things were at their best
My partner ran off with another woman and I simply cannot get over it. Why did he do this to me? </s> <s> That's exactly it! I keep thinking of all the good times we had together and the things that we did before her met Her. I just want those times to come around again even though I know they should not.	It really sucks, doesn't it? And it's not a walk in the park to get over someone when you've been so close to them. Breakups are kind of like a bad cut. They really hurt for a bit, but then a scar eventually forms over it and you start to forget about it.
Do you have a group of friends, or activities to keep you busy while you're going through this? It helps to keep your mind distracted :) </s> <s> I do have some good friends but we also had some mutual friends who have been a bit distant with me since the break up. I guess that I really don't need them though, huh?	Friends come and they go, it doesn't have to be a game of choosing sides. Keep in touch with those that keep in touch with you. Or maybe reach out to some other friends you haven't connected with in awhile.

"It's mainly my husband. His spending habits are out of control. He thinks he need to reward himself for living. We can't survive if he keeps gifting himself. </s> <s> Exactly. And if I push further, he compares himself to other people: ""Well, at least I don't hit you."" or ""At least I'm not an alcoholic"" Like I should thank him for existing."	It sounds like a really toxic relationship - I hear you! I have been in that position also. In the end I felt that I had no choice but to leave. I cannot tell you what to do, though.
I've tried talking to him about it, but he claims that he needs to reward himself or he wouldn't do anything. Like, if he gets up and goes to work then he needs to eat out to reward himself. </s> <s> It's hard because we have children. When we were just dating, he was a different person. He didn't start to act this way until after our eldest was born.	Ah, unfortunately a lot of men are like that - before you become seriously committed they seem totally different. Have you considered seeking professional help?

You said you've been in similar relationships. Is this behavior common for men?	Well no, I don't think that all men are like this by any stretch of the imagination.

Sometimes I worry that maybe I'm just to stingy with the money, but then I remember that we have none, so Idk how to be more generous lol	You sound to me as though you are being realistic and sensible about your financial situation and are being neither too stingy nor too lavish.
I understand that completely. It's very helpful to speak with people face to face. However, have you sought other ways, such as through Zoom, to interact with peers having the same difficulties? </s> <s> zoom is not the same. I am in a techincal trade and need my hands	Classes that involve hands-on work must be very challenging to do online. It sounds like this is a real dilemma.

I feel very much the same way. I am also a student taking online classes this semester. I can't wait until we get back to normal classroom settings, and I also hope fervently that the vaccine process is quick, efficient, and effective.

New jobs and roles are always cause for anxiety. Just being concerned shows what a good employee you are. I think they are lucky to have you!

Should I email them my concerns or is this a face-to-face meeting?	Honestly, I from my own experience, which doesn't include management, I think it's all about the approach.

I would go over your resume and spruce it up before talking to them on Wednesday to add in anything pertinent that you might have learned or achieved during your time with the company these last two years. Make sure the day you approach them that you're well rested, clean and put together. Google some confidence stances and pay attention to your posture. Even if you're feeling nervous there are ways to hide it and appear confident.
Should I talk with my coworker about it? He does not want that job. </s> <s> I just don't want him to think I am trying to weasle my way in.	If he isn't interested in the job himself I'm sure he wouldn't see it that way. It is natural for people to try to move up in a company when a job opening appears, especially in these current times. If you don't go for it then someone else will.
Should I talk with my coworker about it? He does not want that job. </s> <s> He does not want it. I was hoping I at least his support. He does support me. And thanks. I appreciate the insight.

Something you can add to your resume from a peer that shows your initiative.

Yes i told her how i felt and she said she was just busy. I just feel like she is taking me for granted and Im not a priority. </s> <s> I feel like we are all busy but I would find time for her and I dont feel she is doing the same for me.	I see. I would feel the same way if it were in your position. You seem like a person who would go above and beyond for a good friend.
Thank you. I try to be a good friend. My husband thinks I should just not talk to her anymore but we have been friends for almost 10 years. </s> <s> Okay. I think I could take a break. I am just worried I will never find a friendship like we use to have again.	I totally understand that, especially with how long the friendship was. Sometimes just a little time away from eachother works.
You do seem like a wonderful person, and anyone who is your friend would be lucky to say so. It does sound like your husband may be right. or even just taking a break for a little bit. </s> <s> Okay. I will try that. Do you think I should say we need space or just distance myself for a bit and see what happens?	I would just distance it, and see if she reaches out in a week or so. if not, I would just reach out and see how everything is going.
I have personally had to learn how to not buy into false guilt.  If you had plans, then they can ask some people to help out. However, I would consider maybe being flexible one day or two, but not out of guilt, but out of concern. I would personally pray about it. It's a hard situation. </s> <s> Thanks for your advice , I think it all will work out, I think the “big guy” aka as the owner will understand the situation	I'm sure it will all work out.

Thank you! And it is good except for one problem. I am in college and my roommates for next semester do not care about COVID -- they continue to go out and party.

I feel my risk getting it in the room is high if they continue to not respect guidelines.	Do not worry, your fears are totally grounded. Some people really just need to grow up and get educated.
Yes, absolutely. I do not want to get covid and am worried about long term health effects. I have shared this with them but they still do not care. </s> <s> **single not sorority	Yes they certainly have.

This upsets me and I have talked to them about it but they still do not care. </s> <s> I shouldn't do that -- I am applying to law school when I graduate so I feel like it'd be a bad look. it'd also be bad for my mental health to stay home, and I'd rather take the classes I need next semester	So you feel as though you are trapped .. you can't leave school but at the same time you are being put at risk through no fault of your own
Many college students have been very irresponsible during the pandemic which is upsetting to me. </s> <s> also one of them is pre med which is even worse lmao	Please be assured that you are being sensible and that they are the ones at fault
Agreed! Hoping for that vaccine soon </s> <s> what challenges have you faced from the pandemic?	Here in the UK they have started to roll it out.
Agreed! Hoping for that vaccine soon </s> <s> I am so jealous! Things are so much better not in the USA!	I have to agree ;) But we have a large infection and death rate here too, largely due to government irresponsibility

I'm very sad. </s> <s> I found out my boyfriend went to see his ex	I'm sorry to hear you are sad. What's going on? Maybe I can encourage you?
i mean, i literally got into his facebook without asking </s> <s> i just had this intuition that he was being suspicious	It's a hot mess, is it not? Why did you feel you wanted to spy on him? Did you already mistrust him?
He lied because he didn't want you to know the truth. Which is betrayal. </s> <s> it makes sense now that i know he went for a photoshoot	Ok, so this is a HUGE red flag to you. You can ignore it, or not. Women KNOW when a man is cheating, so you had that inside of you. And you went with your hunch and now you have found he is dishonest.
she took all his headshots when he first moved to America, actually </s> <s> when they were together	I suppose it could be Christmas pictures of him for you? Or not. I personally feel honesty is the best policy, no matter what. I would come clean. I would tell him I sensed trouble and looked for it and found it.
i just had this intuition that he was being suspicious </s> <s> i worry that i am jumping to conclusions.	You could be, but then you wouldn't have a feeling of mistrust, you would just be sensing a surprise.
He lied because he didn't want you to know the truth. Which is betrayal. </s> <s> i always invite him when i hang out with my exes	He could say that. And if he is lying, do you think he will begin to be honest? You will have to judge for yourself. If he is lying, he will continue to lie. And you will feel it inside of yourself. Is this the first time you felt this way? Or has this happened before?
I can understand your frustration. It happened to me before. And I've had girlfriends. They never change. They will apologize because they got caught, but they never really change. </s> <s> i guess ur right	I'm an older woman, almost 60. I've been married 20 years but I had a lot of boyfriends and I can tell you one thing, If they start to look elsewhere, run for the hills, they will continue to excuse their behavior, apologize, say they will change, and it just gets worse. I drove myself insane with worry, suspicion. I wanted someone to treasure me, not cheat and lie. Cheaters don't change their spots.
Ah, so you were overseas and were conducting the relationship long distance? </s> <s> She kept me going while I was gone, but since I returned, she's been so cold to me	Do you feel that is unfair of her to have done this whilst you were away serving your country?
She kept me going while I was gone, but since I returned, she's been so cold to me </s> <s> Possibly, but we weren't official boyfriend/girlfriend	Ah I see. How committed did you feel to her?
Maybe it was my indecision to ask her about our relationship </s> <s> Now that I think about it, it seemed more of 80% me, 20% her	I know, as a woman myself. that it is quite difficult when you are seeing someone but have no idea what their intentions are.
Have you considered getting some sort of counselling, either just you or as a couple? </s> <s> Should I seek counseling for a relationship that technically wasn't official?	I am hearing you say that you still have feelings for her but you are not sure whether to totally break away or not, given that she has
Maybe it was my indecision to ask her about our relationship </s> <s> My gut tells me that I'm not going to take 2nd place in her heart	It has to be your decision but I think you will know if you've made the right one.
Thank you and best wishes! </s> <s> You too! Take care!	I have to stay here but feel free to show yourself out :)

I have my first dog so I don't know much, he is 9 years old and came with our house. </s> <s> How did your dog come with the house?	Was that your only pet? Or do you have others? We moved from FL to KY and the little dog just hung out here, he really belonged to the neighbor's son who didn't want him, so he just ran around wild and wouldn't leave. I never had a dog, but it got cold, so i took him in. They never asked about him and after a week, I asked them if I could have the dog, so they said yes. I don't think they cared.
I have 2 other dogs that are mine and my boyfriend has 2 </s> <s> We both had dogs when we met.	So you definitely are a dog lover! I was in my 50s before I ever had a dog, now I wish I had more, they are really loving. Not like cats who don't care much about much except FOOD! lol
I know when tragedy happens, I can't get stuck in depression, I sort of have to force myself to put one foot in front of the other.

Pushing through though I guess is all one can do then. Thank you so much. I believe in prayer.	Prayer is what gets me through every day!  :D  It was rough, but I believe these hard times strengthen us in some way. Because life throws hard balls, and we have to move forward or be consumed.

Yes - he's always irritable! ha ha. So instead of answering, he launched into this thing about how COVID antibodies disappear, so the tests are pointless. I know there are some issues with the various tests. As it happens, I have a PhD in immunology, so I know a lot about this stuff... </s> <s> Yes - I want to be friends! It's not me...

I feel the same way. I cant wait for life to be normal again. It has been a hard year. </s> <s> I don't know if life will ever be normal again.	Do you live alone? Do you mean meeting new people or getting together with people you already know? I am naturally an introvert, so it honestly didnt bother me the first month or so... but I'm so over it now. I wish I had taken advantage of freedoms we had before all of this.
I currently live in a place that is totally lonely. It is not because of the virus but just because people aren't able to reach out or there are no viable places to meet and greet. </s> <s> The freedoms are still there but the fear of getting the virus stops people from normal life.	I think it will pass eventually, but who knows when. It feels like every where you look things are falling apart sometimes. What kind of place do you live in?
The freedoms are still there but the fear of getting the virus stops people from normal life. </s> <s> Currently I live in a hotel getting ready to travel to another state. What about you?	You're so right.... I miss not fearing the virus. I don't fear at as much as I did, but I fear giving it to a loved one. Do you travel a lot for work?
I think it will pass eventually, but who knows when. It feels like every where you look things are falling apart sometimes. What kind of place do you live in? </s> <s> No for personal reasons. I just find the disparity between wearing the mask in some states is not as demanding s others. Here the masks do not seem to be mandatory, but 100 miles and it is necessary.	Some people are on lockdowns, I'm nervous about our income in the next few months with the talk of more stay at home orders. I know it feels like itll be like this forever but I really dont believe it will. It may get worse before it gets better but I think things will go back to normal eventually.
No for personal reasons. I just find the disparity between wearing the mask in some states is not as demanding s others. Here the masks do not seem to be mandatory, but 100 miles and it is necessary. </s> <s> I think we are in a long period of recovery because the country has too many laws in different states that are causing demands on the health system.	I have traveled states recently and the difference is crazy! I went through Tennessee, missippi, and alabama and stopped a few times.. some places are just going on like normal, hardly any masks.. in arkansas you never see anyone indoors without one.
Too much politics behand the virus and helping the people. </s> <s> Florida is mandatory, but Georgia is lacks. Tennessee is mandatory but other states are not as caring.	I totally agree. And you never know what is true or not. Its stressful. I'm in georgia now and most people do not wear them unless asked. I've only been required to at dr appointment. Is it mandatory where you are now?
The freedoms are still there but the fear of getting the virus stops people from normal life. </s> <s> Georgia has a high virus rate, yet no mandatory masks.	There are signs here but half the shoppers dont wear them. I think people here dont fear it as much as other places.
Georgia has a high virus rate, yet no mandatory masks. </s> <s> You walk in and the employees don't even wear them. The screens aren't  going to stop the spread.	So you travel because you want to? YES the gas station closest to me.... I have been in there every other day recently and never seen a person in a mask. The employees at the dollar general close to me dont wear them either. I dont think it will either honestly. Sometimes I feel guilty if I'm not wearing one. The uncertainty of everything gets to me.
The freedoms are still there but the fear of getting the virus stops people from normal life. </s> <s> I miss the bneaches	I wear mine to protect other people.... I do have health issues that could complicate things but I dont thing it will stop me from getting it.
I understand for protecting others, but when the people around you ignore the virus and refuse a mask, they aren't concerned about you. </s> <s> Masks are mandatory otherwise no entry at the stores	well I hope you are able to connect with people soon.. I think these are cool.. Its nice to talk to new. Youre right generally people dont care for other people, but I'm not that way. Panama City Beach.

Hello my boss and mentor was just diagnosed with cancer </s> <s> It showed up in her eyes. Right now they aren’t sure what stage until she gets more details.	You must be feeling very distressed about it right now. I am happy to talk about it.
Yes. She is trying to be strong and only told about 4 people. I am trying to be strong for her but it is hard not seeing someone in person right now. </s> <s> No. It’s hard to have a good support system and I’m worried about her.	Does she have anyone else around her who is supporting her?
Yes. She is trying to be strong and only told about 4 people. I am trying to be strong for her but it is hard not seeing someone in person right now. </s> <s> She has her husband but limited friends in there area. I want to make sure I am being there and providing correct support.	Do you feel that you are not offering as much support as you might?
She has her husband but limited friends in there area. I want to make sure I am being there and providing correct support. </s> <s> She lives in another state. I’m not sure how to properly support her.	I know how you feel. It can be very difficult to know what to say if someone is seriously ill. Sometimes it's better just to offer quiet support and tell people that you are there to listen if they need you.
She has her husband but limited friends in there area. I want to make sure I am being there and providing correct support. </s> <s> That is good advice. Have you been through something like that?	Yes I have. My sister in law was diagnosed with cervical cancer and I wanted to be supportive but I had no real idea what to say.
I actually talked to a counsellor about it. I think that you should do that, it might help you a lot. </s> <s> Maybe even a cancer support group? I want to make sure I’m encouraging her.	Counselling can be expensive but there are some charities out there that offer a few sessions for free
No. It’s hard to have a good support system and I’m worried about her. </s> <s> I know with covid it is important to be mindful of cost.	How do you feel in yourself at the moment? Are you worried about your own health?
I’m not worried about my health. More worried and sad about her. Especially not knowing how severe it is yet. It seems like any extra stress this year is harder to handle. </s> <s> I agree.

I have been struggling for motivation to do anything the past couple weeks.  This is a really hard time of year for me.  I lost my cousin in a car accident at the age of 14 in a car accident coming up on 20 years this year.  We were very close.  I was 17 at the time.  Her was an alcoholic and my parents raised her a majority of her life.  Then 3 years ago 5 days after her death anniversary I lost my boyfriend at the age of 32 in a car accident.  I dread the holidays. </s> <s> I usually go all out for the holidays to try to hide my depression every year.  This year I just can't bring myself to enjoy them.  I have even bought one christmas present.	I can see why this time of year is difficult for you. Trying to hide depression can be a challenge. Rather than hiding the sadness or grieving feelings, some people find relief in acknowledging and sharing these feelings with family members who may relate. Do you ever share these feelings with your cousin or grandparents that you mentioned?
You are exactly right.  The year my cousin got killed her mom was hungover so I went and picked up my cousin and her little brother to take them to our grandparents house for Christmas dinner.  She died 4 days later on Dec 29th.  And my boyfriend it was his first day back to work after the New Year.  He died on Jan 3rd. </s> <s> My family has always been really good about talking about our loses. Things just will never be the same.	I understand. When losses are experienced it is a great change in many aspects of our lives.
I usually go all out for the holidays to try to hide my depression every year.  This year I just can't bring myself to enjoy them.  I have even bought one christmas present. </s> <s> They say it gets easier. And I agree it does.  Things just have changed so much.  I miss how life was before I lost them.	I understand - and it is normal to feel that way. When we lose someone who brought us happiness, it is only natural to miss them and their company.
I love giving gifts.  And I always put lots of thought into the gifts I give.  My nieces and nephews can't wait every year to see what I got them. </s> <s> This year I am tie dying hooded sweatshirts.  I make tshirts for a hobby.  And to tell you the truth thats the only gifts I have gotten so far.  My oldest daughter turned 18 this year and lives with her boyfriend so its just me and my 15 year old daughter.  She struggles with depression/anxiety as well.  Her dad has been in jail for some stupid actions since August.  She has had to deal with him being an addict pretty much her whole life.  I think we are both missing how the holidays were with her sister still living at home.  Too much change in our lives in such a little time frame.	Wow, what a great gift idea! That is a solid start on your gifts for the season, and something to be proud of.
That's great! You must have a special talent for personalizing your gift selections. Perhaps focus on that reaction from you nieces and nephews to support your motivation for giving gifts this year. </s> <s> They will love them.  A couple years ago I put their names on fleece blankets when I worked at an embroidery shop.  They absolutly loved them!	And I see, it sounds like the changes in your life are potentially impacting your daughter as well. However, I'm glad you have each other for support this season. This year has been crazy for many reasons, and many people tend to find comfort in routines or traditions. Do you and your daughters have any holiday traditions you typically complete?
Have you considered any sort of bereavement counselling? Addiction in a partner is a very hard thing to have to deal with. It is not your fault! </s> <s> I haven't done any counseling.  I know I should and it would probably help me.  I don't know why I have not.	I have previously had counselling and found it very useful but there is a long waiting list for a free counsellor
I had decided that I was gonna wait to hear from him that day instead of texting or calling him.  I wanted him to realize how upset his addiction made me. Instead the phone call I got was that he had been killed. </s> <s> I don't feel guilt about it.  Now at least.  I was pretty hard on myself at first.  But I know that he knows why I was upset that morning.  It was something we dealt with a lot.	Are you still in touch with his family and friends?
I haven't done any counseling.  I know I should and it would probably help me.  I don't know why I have not. </s> <s> I went and talked to a therapist once right after and never went back.  And I don't know why.  He was amazing to talk too.  But I just never went back.	I think you should do things in your own time but I would recommend doing it again one day.

Instead the phone call I got was that he had been killed. </s> <s> I don't have any contact with his family.  I actually had to block them on all social media.  They are extremely religous.  Which there is nothing wrong with that.  But he didn't have the best relationship with any of them.  They couldn't accept him for who he was.  His biological father didn't have anything to do with him.  His mom was remarried and had two more kids and they didn't treat my boyfriend very good growing up.  He ended up living with his grandparents.  He finally had acceptance in my family.  He actually talked to my mom more than I did lol.	Sounds like a very complicated set up. It is sad when family members become partially estranged from one another.

And I know it's because they have guilt for the way things were with their relationship.  They didn't even invite me and my girls to the burial of his ashes.	That is extremely offensive and I think you would have had the right to contest that.

I think it's a serious issue, him not being honest with you over trivial things. At the same time, breaking up  without any other issues is kind of not optimal considered you;ve dated for 1 year

yeah truuue tysm. one of the girls he lusted over goes to college w us and she literally got kicked out of her sorority last year for sexually assaulting a guy who was passed out drunk and posted it on her snap story and he didn't care at all bc she posted cute pics of her booty lmao I was just so disgusted since I was r*ped last year at a frat house and like idk how u can still have any kind of attraction to people who do terrible things like that </s> <s> its so annoying boys are gross and I am def overly sensitive but its frustrating lol	I am so sorry to hear that, you are not oversensitive at all. Trust me, any normal girls would feel the same
and it wasn't just like he lied once he did it constantly over the course of a year of dating  and hid everything and cleared his search and all that </s> <s> should I break up with him since I can't get over him doing that	Breaking up over this is a pity, however, he doesn't seem trustworthy after everything you told me. How about give him some time, 3-6 months and see if he changes at all. If not or if you really think he's not worth your time, go ahead and cut tie with him
2020 has just been a bad year, i got kicked out of my dads house and also lost my main job because i was working with him </s> <s> im trying to go back to school now but with a part time job it feels hard to do that	So you have been made homeless and have lost touch with one of your closest relatives?
I understand how you feel. I am estranged from my mother. Is there any chance you could reconcile? </s> <s> I am already in therapy with him but it doesnt seem to be helping that much	Please know that you are not alone in this situation.

we ended up having a talk to which I told him that his job is patient care since he is a physician and he took great offense to that </s> <s> thus truly kicking me out	To me this sounds like a very toxic relationship.

My friend Mark is suffering from bi-polar disorder, and despite being on medication, is spiraling out of control. </s> <s> His mood swings are affecting his ability to stay employed and keep friends and family from wanting to interact with him.	I am so sorry about your friend mark. I will try my best to help you today.
I suspect he's not taking his medication as prescribed.  He's become a sociopath, which I understand is common with people suffering from this disorder.  He's unable to be empathic or sympathetic to anyone else's life. </s> <s> I have talked to him repeatedly.  Each time, he assures me that he understands my concerns and that he's going to get things together.  Literally, within a day or two, I hear from a mutual friend or family member that he's reverted back to doing things that are sociopathic.	Have you asked him about him taking his medication?
"I have.  He tells me that he's taking it regularly (or most of the time).  I challenged him on it and told him it can't be ""most of the time.""  That's why I sent his doctor a long email, explaining things to him, to see if he can't intervene and try to straighten him out. </s> <s> You're right.  Mental illness, in all of its forms, is especially challenging.  Physical illness is more easy to understand, of course."	you are right. So do not think he is doing it on purpose. Do not let it bring you down or hurt your feelings in anyway.
Thank you.  I think you understand the sadness and anxiety in feeling powerless in this situation (or mostly powerless).  I have no real expertise in this area, but by contacting his doctor, maybe he can reevaluate whether the medicine and dosage needs to be changed. </s> <s> Funny you ask.  He's a grown man - 35-years old.  I've never known him to have this issue, which seems so strange to me.	I understand a lot.

Thanks for carrying my burden and offering your support. </s> <s> Before we end the conversation, I'd love hearing a few of those suggestions, if you don't mind.	ok. just be there for him no matter what because you know he can not help it.

Things have been pretty rough for the last few years. I found out she was hanging out with her ex and she lied about it </s> <s> yeah, plus our relationship has been rocky for the past year.

Just having problems with some friends. I feel like I am being left out. </s> <s> They leave me out of planned outings from time to time. They also do not seem to care if I come or go when I am invited	Have you asked your friends regarding this?
Okay, maybe you should ask your friends, let them know how you feel and see what they say about it </s> <s> Okay, I may try that. What do you think I should do if they are negatively receptive of it?	Under any circumstances, make sure you know you are not at wrong here.I hope it will not be the case but your friends might try victim blaming
Under any circumstances, make sure you know you are not at wrong here.I hope it will not be the case but your friends might try victim blaming </s> <s> Yeah, I don't want it to come off as an attack on my end.

Yeah, I don't want it to come off as an attack on my end. Maybe I should wait, see if the issue occurs continuously, note that it has been observed on multiple occasions, and then stand my ground? </s> <s> That's true!	What you need to do is note down the occasions where they exclude you and ask exactly what happened then
Under any circumstances, make sure you know you are not at wrong here.I hope it will not be the case but your friends might try victim blaming </s> <s> Then, I can ask like, was there a reason why I was not invited on this instance? Did I do anything to offend, etc	Yes, that's good, ask them if you did something that offended them and why they excluded you. If they deny, then you can tell them how you feel. If they care about your friendship they will do something to fix
Under any circumstances, make sure you know you are not at wrong here.I hope it will not be the case but your friends might try victim blaming </s> <s> That is good advice. What is your advice if I still come out of the situation negatively (e.g. the friends do not seem to care about the friendship?)	honestly, I think you also know that if you care about someone and they feel upset, you'll do everything you can to help the situation. Therefore, if your friends refuse to acknowledge your feelings, I don't think you should be friends either
My work is driving me nuts. </s> <s> I just found out my boss cut my pay and my bonus to secure his own bonus	wow, that's super frustrating! I would be pretty upset too
"I overheard a private phone call with his wife. He said that despite the tough year the company is having, he's expecting to get a large bonus because he cut costs so drastically. </s> <s> I also heard him discuss it with the director of sales. They were strategizing how to shift the costs around to cover the tracks. I heard the words ""good thing we have the power, if others knew we were getting our full bonuses they'd walk out"""	wow... did anyone else hear?
that's good! I think budgets are going to be tight in many industries and you need to make sure you are okay financially and have insurance and unfortuantely both of those are tied to employers. </s> <s> I know... This pandemic is frustrating. I wish I could just walk out but realistically It'd be pretty irresponsible to quit during a global pandemic and not have insurance.	That's a good point. I suggest continuing to look and see what you can find. There will be people hiring.

We thankfully have not got on lockdown just yet, but I know it will be happening soon. We live in a very small town and it has got bad here that either we know someone who has it, or someone in the family has it.

And god forbid anything happens to you and you do loose your job just know there are a lot of resources around that would help you in any struggles that you fear or end up facing.

Think about the bad things that will happen if I lost my job. I have been only thinking about the bad.. </s> <s> Yes, this is why, if I lose my job, my financial situation will affect the family.	I have children as well, and what I have tried to do is like a at home drive in movie night, or simple board games. I don't have a spouse but I would think maybe an inside dinner night or even a lunch date. Have the kids even help out with that. You'll be amazed on how excited they would be even if it's the little things they can help with like the seating or drawing of the menus. And for maybe the inside drive in make up little movie tickets, and candy and popcorn like a little concession stand.

I completely understand. I know its hard not to think about it because it is EVERYWHERE, but if your spouse or children see or sense the stress its causing you they can also feel it, and can start stressing over it too. Even trying these things will cause a smile and a fun time for those moments that will make every one happy and not think about covid, because they will all be thinking about how much fun they are having with you and the family, and that will help with the stress even if its just a little bit.

Maybe you can write that on your list -- perhaps just brainstorm ways to make new friends - take a college class, join a gym, take a dance class, volunteer at church, something like that.

I don't want to lose her, so if I need to look into a different section of my field, I definitely could.	I'm sure she's considered it, expressing interest in both of those areas could just be that you're sending mixed messages too. So really, just talking it out is your best bet. Good luck!

it's much more suitable if i could mix up the details of each career paths </s> <s> but like they said architecture suits my strengths more and i can go further with it	honestly i think both are great career paths to pursue and as you said, both are stable and well-paying fields

I said that I have had trouble getting over losing a friend who I thought was my best friend for years but eventually I found out he was only acting and he didn't really care about me at all. It's been about a year since he told me that, and whenever I think about it it makes me sad. </s> <s> I don't know why it's so hard for me to get over it	Betrayal is a hard pill to swallow.

Those situation sometimes shows us there was time in that friendship where we could have been over extending ourselves. Those are the times we should have been given more love and attention to our self.  We learn how to love ourselves more we others don't reciprocate what we give them. I think it ultimately about being a better friend to you first.

another thing you might try is an online cooking lesson or something. with more people staying home and eating in, they might be interested in learning how to cook better food for themselves </s> <s> You know what, i have never thought of that.

I dont know if i know how to even set that stuff up.	that sounds like an opportunity in itself to me. i'm sure there are tons of people out there that have the business stuff but don't have the cooking skills. you could find a partner to help, and that way you won't have to do everything alone.

Lost the job I moved here for, most of the friends I had made needed to move back in with family, it's just a mess. </s> <s> It's strange honestly.

Will they give you severance?  Do you qualify for unemployment?  Any offer for retraining or job assistance? </s> <s> It is hard emotionally - as well as financially.  I tried calling the unemployment office to find out what help they may have but no one answered me. 3	Your not getting the unemployment office to respond seems to be a common problem.  They weren't geared up for this.  Fortunately, the online portal has been helpful for many.

Do you know what has changed? You said that the teenagers are more interested in getting presents than actually celebrating the holiday itself. Is that a major reason? What about your husband?
That and the teenagers aren't listening well. They're kinda out of control. I don't think they deserve a Christmas, because they need to learn responsibility. </s> <s> My husband tends to think they do no matter what.	I see. You are frustrated with them because of the way they have been behaving. What do you think they should be doing differently?

"Yep, for me it's kind of felt like working remotely and all the crazy 2020 stuff was kind of an excuse to just ""take a break"" from grinding.

Since I've been back on MTurk and trying to be more active these last couple weeks, I had one on Saturday and really enjoyed it.

You have great pritoritizing and time management skills 3. You learn new things easily and with little instruction.  All of these things are skill sets that many employers find extremely desirable.

It's kind of awkward in the neighborhood. </s> <s> Well, the ex has gotten in the wife's face once or twice, but that's simmered down some.   Part of the problem also is that the ex is simultaneously one of the smartest people I've ever met, and also a pretty serious alcoholic.

I have had trouble sleeping in the past and sometimes I still do, usually if it is when I'm nervous about the future.
The number one way I have had to help my depression is to pray and read scripture. I don't know if you are a Christian, but that has helped me a lot. The second way is to have a good friend who will listen, not someone who will TELL me what to do or judge me, but someone who can empathize with me. A good listener is worth her weight in gold. </s> <s> I've learned that mines not really an emotional thing. I feel like my sleeping issue causes my depression. Because no matter what- i always feel exhausted. Nothing has helped it besides medication. It just sucks always feeling fatigued and energyless. I actually did take up religion here this year to help with the coping that comes with this. It was very helpful for a while there	If I didn't get good rest, then I would definitely feel tired the next day and over time, it would wear me out. I believe medication will help with the symptoms, but it is important to get the root of the problem, why exactly you find it difficult to sleep.
I've learned that mines not really an emotional thing. I feel like my sleeping issue causes my depression. Because no matter what- i always feel exhausted. Nothing has helped it besides medication. It just sucks always feeling fatigued and energyless. I actually did take up religion here this year to help with the coping that comes with this. It was very helpful for a while there </s> <s> I plan on seeing a sleep doctor soon! Sometimes I lose sight of fixing the issue and need to be reminded. And yes!! I was treating my sleeping with Benadryl as well but it wasn't healthy to keep doing that.	I'm also thinking there are a few practical ways you can help yourself sleep. I was advised to get soft sheets, make my sleeping area more restful, make sure the time before bed is relaxing and calming.

I was treating my sleeping with Benadryl as well but it wasn't healthy to keep doing that. </s> <s> I always lose sight of how to make things better. It really helps to talk sometimes so someone can help me put things into perspective. I'll look into Frank Hammond! I am actually religious and would love to look into that.	"I will definitely pray for you tonight because I know losing sleep is hard to deal with. But please have hope, sometimes we go through these things to possible get to deeper issues that might need to be dealt with. We only have a few minutes here, but I'm pretty old and I have found this to be true so many times.  Get a good support system of good friends. Having people who ""get"" you is SO vital to our lives. And learning to be grateful helps too. And especially journal, find out what may be bothering you."
I had some abuse issues and that is why I had a hard time resting. I also would wake up in the middle of the night and obsess over problems with people. I had a lot to work through, but most nights, I sleep restful now. It may take time. </s> <s> That sounds very similar to my situation! I always had some abuse issues. Thank you so much .

Every one is different, but it is worth a shot, might help the rut your having, might also give you new ideas that will help you decide on how to not feel like your in a rut anymore. Sometimes just talking to someone can help too, bouncing ideas off of each other can help in some cases. </s> <s> True,  I have been avoiding most people.	Its hard to talk about certain problems, so I can't blame you, however you can get some good ideas from others. You might have just needed some space to evaluate your situation, nothing wrong with taking a break from things or people if it helps you.

I don't believe that you did anything wrong whatsoever. Sometimes, really unfair things happen to really good people. I can't even imagine how hard this must be, but I would try to look at it in a positive way. I know that losing your best friend and your fiancé must be devastating, but at least you now know that your fiancé is someone who you most certainly probably don't want to spend the rest of your life with. </s> <s> Were you married to him?	I think I would start by putting your own health first and getting yourself tested to make sure that you haven't contracted anything from your fiancé. I know this will be incredibly hard, but I wouldn't want to see you getting sick and suffering as a result of his infidelity.
I know that their first child is a girl. I'm not sure if their second is a girl or a boy. I haven't spoken to him in several years. I found out through a friend about their second child.

I have too much to lose.  I just feel bad like i am abandoning her.	The thing is with drugs, that person already abandoned themselves. Sometimes they can get the help they need, but they need to do it on their own terms. Its kind of like a blackhole where everything gets sucked into their life.

I would look to talk to a therapist about these matters.

It's pretty normal for relationships to not necessarily survive through things like this
Yeah, I mean it's never easy going through a breakup, but people change as they get older and mature, and they aren't necessarily going to still be compatible the whole time.   Also I think it's important to not think of a relationship that peters out as a failed one.   Just because it didn't last until one of you died doesn't mean it wasn't a success.   I think people put too much emphasis on permanence. </s> <s> That's true, it can maybe just be a stepping stone to build other relationships.  Thanks for the wisdom.	Well I've got a couple decades on you, so I've been through this a few times before.   Actually I'm still friends with pretty much all of my exes.   I mean just because I'm not romantically involved with them anymore doesn't mean that they aren't still terrific people.   Hell, I hung out with two of them just today.

I see trust is a very important key factor in relationships and without it the relationship stays stagnant. Have you tried reassuring her that your intentions are pure and maybe gave her some words of affirmation that would let her know how you truly feel about her?

Sometimes moving on from a relationship and staying single from some time can give you time to reflect and work on yourself for yourself.

Honestly, its not anyone else's business. IF you're suspicions are in fact correct, then you've got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart-breaking 10.

I absolutely do not mean to suggest a dispute or argument. That will not help either. Simply ask her about the things that you KNOW aren't acceptable; lying about how long her trip was is one of them. Also, its okay to talk about how that stuff makes you feel, but try not to project your feelings as her fault. I know that it seems like they are... But she didn't MAKE you feel any specific way, even if her ACTIONS influenced how you were already feeling.

I sympathise with you because it must be terrible to feel that you are stuck in something that you really no longer like and yet be afraid to try and change your situation.

What if she isn't available? </s> <s> What like support groups etc? I'm also sure this isn't just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. It's weird and a little concerning to be honest.	Not necessarily support groups, but more like psychiatry apps where a trained professional is available via chat, or video and its specifically through the app.
It wouldn't hurt to try and reach out. If she isn't available, there are other services. </s> <s> I hadn't thought of that. I know there are a few of these nowadays.	There a lot more since Covid began in March, so it's worth as a backup plan if your doctor isn't available. Sometimes its good to have options.
Talking to a professional is always ideal. Is there a way to see that psychiatrist again? </s> <s> I think this is why it's always best to see a professional. I really should try to reconnect with mine.	I agree. There is a lot of well meaning advice out there, but its best to see a professional to really help you.
I'll start a plan and seeing if I can see my usual therapist and go from there. Sometimes it just helps talk it through depression stops you from seeing things clearly. Do you have any experience with mental health issues? </s> <s> Thanks for the chat, it has helped me put things in perspective.	I'm glad I could help.

Yeah to be honest if you press the issue and ask if anything is going and you continue to get toxic responses. It might be time to end the friendship.

Of course! I like to wake up a little earlier and at least get started on an assignment to feel like I have accomplished something at least before the rest of the world wakes up.

Do you have any suggestions for good brands that I should use to help make my notes better?	Uniball makes really good pens that the option to switch colors on the pen, but they sell packs with different colors too. I like to use red ink for really important things, and blue for things I might think I will need later but aren't sure.

I usually don't set an alarm and find myself rushing around before class	I personally wake up around 6AM and have just gotten used to it so I wake up that time no matter what. I blame the army.  But, an alarm on your phone or computer can be effective. Even having someone you know that wakes up early call you can be a help, provided you are not grumpy at being woke up :)

I should try that and put my phone on the other side of the room next time I want to wake up earlier. I personally use the most annoying thing I can find as a ringtone/alarm, so that I will make every effort to turn it off but a lot of the alarm clocks you can find in stores are plenty loud and annoying.

It feels much easier to just wake up and go onto my computer than having to get ready in the morning and drive to campus. I think I mostly miss that routine. Because of that, I also find myself going to bed much later than I should be, even on school nights.	That is a good rational reason I would say, I do online classes too and it is far too easy just to wake up, go to the computer and that is it for the day. Campus life seems more structured and like you could plan a routine, but being stuck at home sort of changes all of that.

Oh I see. Well personally, when I was going through a hard time and I felt like I didn't have any friends, I found a couple pretty cool apps that helped me out!

I'm not feeling great. I applied for a job recently which took a lot of time. I now have an interview and it's in 3 days. I'm getting really nervous about this because I think I need longer to prepare. </s> <s> Yes perhaps. I need to draw on previous experience so I think I'll need to prepare. I'm just so busy at work these days I just don;t think I'll have the time.	I can see that you are feeling a large amount of stress about the situation.
Would it be possible to take one or more days off from work to give yourself more time? </s> <s> Potentially but this is very short notice, usually I have to provide more notice for leave from work.	Yes, I have had to deal with time pressures quite a few times. I am sure most people have in the modern era where everything moves so fast. I have usually gotten help from friends, or done my best to delay or remove other commitments from my life. As a last resort, I have sometimes had to accept that I would be getting less sleep than usual for a few days.
Perhaps I can ask if I can finish early from work for the next couple of days and get some time that way. I do think however I'll be more nervous due to less time to prepare. The thing is I'd delay the interview but this might affect my chances. </s> <s> I suppose I could ask my partner to look after the childcare for the next couple of days.	That seems like a good idea, unless that will be likely to cause you other problems. You seem like a hard working, diligent type of person that can make this work if you make the effort.

Well, everyone handles stressful situations differently, but there are some things you can do or try that might help.

You can decide that while you would like to get this new job, the world will not end if you don't get it, and you will worry less and have less stress. Also there is the classic technique of picturing your interviewer in their underwear. It makes them seem less imposing, and you can feel more confident.

How you thought of any other alternatives that could help your family, regarding the process of obtaining guns during a Biden presidency? </s> <s> not a clue. do you have any suggestions?	Definitely! My first step would be understanding the gun policy that Biden would have and confirming the new process. Does that sound like something that could be a good starting point?

That's understandable. Most parents feel like you do so you're not alone. When I feel closed off I write. I make up stories where I'm always the heroe. Don't laugh. I always overcome some issue. I also write letters just to get out what I'm feeling. It helps and you should try it. Start a diary or write letters to your son so you can share them with him one . Are these activities you might like to try?

"it's irresponsible and they share information slowly to the public and don't disclose enough information. And they are still not shutting down gyms or restaurants, when they are the main sources right now in my city. </s> <s> too slow and they don't believe in shutting down essential businesses when that will stop it once and for all after two or three weeks. They did that earlier this year for the first wave and that pretty much did the trick. And today they openly said that unless deemed necessary, they will only shut down 
selective places because restaurants need to stay open for business, etc."	hmm, that's a bummer.

Yeah, apparently the covid situation was getting to him and after he lost his job, he decided he wanted to find himself and try the single life after ten years together </s> <s> Yeah, thankfully, I was basically supporting us both. It was just the shock of it all. I came home from work and he was packing his things, no discussion, nothing just it's over and I've literally been crying all day. I don;t even think I miss him, I'm just mad about how he went about it	That is cruel, I am sure you are in shock, to leave without an explanation, or a real one is terrible. So you have no contact withim what so ever?
No contact, I sort of lost my temper when he tried to talk things over because I think he was going to use this as a threat but I was so disgusted after being tired from work that I just threw my phone and now my way of contacting him is gone </s> <s> I sort of don't think I want him back. Not when he thinks our relationship is some sort of pawn for him to hold over my head. It sucks because my parents didn't even like him, I stuck my neck out for him and now this happens	Well I am sure it sucks and feels a bit lonely. But if you dont want him back have a glass of wine and celebrate the you, you deserve the best and nothing less.

Maybe that is not all bad, gives him time to think and you too. And if he regrets what he did he will return. But then you would have to make a decission, if you would want him back. </s> <s> Thank you and you too	Bye, you need to close the conversation please

I also already have to schedule and routinize my day because I work and go to school from home, so I make sure to give myself breaks where I literally must get up and leave my desk, be in another room for a little while. </s> <s> Bad cycle	Sure, that's understandable.  There are opportunities throughout the day to get a little more vitamin D, you just have to make sure to give yourself time to enjoy them.
Time is the fire in which we burn. </s> <s> The pandemic heightens all our awareness of time and mortality	Sometimes, to me, the enormity of the universe is calming to my anxiety.  Being assured that I mean absolutely nothing is nice sometimes.

The pandemic and economic downturn keep me up at night. </s> <s> Yes, how the pandemic will play out mostly.	Things are very uncertain these days.  I certainly have never experienced anything like it.
Personally, I have tried to lessen my anxiety by limiting my intake of news and social media.  No matter what one might believe, there's always someone out there that's apparently going to take it to an extreme, and reading over and over about that is emotionally exhausting. </s> <s> How do you comfort yourself that it's not that bad?	Well, I don't try to deny the seriousness of the situation at all.  But I do try to keep myself and my family healthy, physically and mentally, and maintain my close friendships via text/video.
And I schedule my day, even though I'm working and going to school from home.  I schedule breaks to go out and enjoy the fresh air, dance like an idiot to some music, play with my dogs, or whatever is refreshing. </s> <s> I will take your advice.	A routine has been really really helpful.  I also make sure to get plenty of sunshine.  As the winter comes in, we have shorter days and it feels suffocating.

And that's not to say you can turn off your emotions or anything, but once you let go of the idea that you can control someone else to your liking, you will feel better.  Less out of control.  Because that's a lot of what is disturbing about the pandemic.  We have zero control over it.

I am just not able to help my tendencies to sleep really late and wake up late. My sleep pattern is really abnormal and I am disappointed in myself. It's not much about the pandemic as just gotten a really bad habit and trying to stay up late and watch movies or catch up with my work.

I still am not prepared to go out even for walks. But that's just my stubborn thinking.	In order to have better sleep pattern, maybe you should exercise, at first your body will be tired which helps you sleep better and earlier

I've submitted around that many applications if not more before I found my current job. But working as a temp at other companies has helped me provide for myself in the meantime. :)

It's just not something I want to go through again. I just got this job 18 months ago. That job hunting dread and feeling hasn't gone away.	I understand. It definitely is an agonizing process but you've gone through it before and have 18 months of experience under your belt from your current job which looks good on any resume. Despite the pandemic, I think this will help make things a lot easier for you.
I've been feeling really sad lately. I think I have depression </s> <s> It's 2020 so there's been a lot going on, but I've been struggling with this before all of that. 2020 has made it much worse though	I am sorry you feel this way. Do you live with friends or family?

It takes a lot of commitment to your friendship to not only keep in touch for that long, but also make the time to support them emotionally when it matters most. You are a loyal friend, and your friend is lucky to have you around!

Hi. I am looking for support for depression.  My fiance died four years ago today and I am very sad. </s> <s> Very sad.  I think about him often.	It is sad indeed having a loved one past. Having time will help.
Some takes weeks. Others take month or years. It's different for everyone. I know where you are coming from. I lost my husband a couple years ago and it took me awhile to move on as well. </s> <s> I'm so sorry.  It is very hard, isn't it?  I know time is helping, but sometimes, like today, it's just overwhelming how much I miss him.

I think perhaps you could think of the wonderful times that you spent with your fiance, and cherish those feelings. </s> <s> But most of all, it was that he loved me.  He loved me for me ... he didn't want me to be anyone or anything else. That was a miracle.	That is so sweet. How are you feeling now with all these memories coming back to you?
i've been trying to figure out a hobby ... but i haven't really found anything that appeals to me.  a cooking class sounds interesting though. i might learn how to do things in the kitchen without injuring myself. </s> <s> I tend to be clumsy at the best of times and have done things such as (most recently) dropping a scalding bowl of chili on my foot.  I tend to wait to do new things til the last injury heals.	I think you will do fine in the kitchen once you get the hang of it. What are some of your favorite food?
hmmm.  i love tacos.  and stews.  cheesecake. </s> <s> i used to bake ... but i'm diabetic so that's probably not such a good idea any more.  and since we're working at home now i can't bake and take it into the office for people to enjoy	Yes, I enjoy tacos and cheesecake as well, especially from the Cheesecake Factory.
"actually i am feeling somewhat better.  still sad, but it's good to remember those things.  thank you. </s> <s> I am going to go now. Thank you very much for your support. It helps to have an ""ear"" ... just to be able to talk about it and be reminded that it's all going to be okay.  Plus, that there's cheesecake in the world, so it can't all be bad, right?"	Okay, I'm glad you are feeling better. Enjoy the rest of your day and stay safe.
Ive been feeling like other people dont like me </s> <s> Yes, i automatically assume I'm valueless in the other persons eyes, no matter what they say or do to the contrary	It seems you are a bit low on self-confidence. I have been there too. If I may ask you, does this feeling persist all the time irrespective of the situation or it happens after any particular event - say a test or some outdoor game for example?
Yes, i automatically assume I'm valueless in the other persons eyes, no matter what they say or do to the contrary </s> <s> Yeah, I've been texting my friend and he doesn't reply to me for hours and it makes me feel like he isnt as enthusiastic about our friendship as i am which hurts	Right, the feeling of being ignored can be quite overwhelming. Have you tried speaking with your friend over phone or video call, assuming you have access to the technology?
Yes, i automatically assume I'm valueless in the other persons eyes, no matter what they say or do to the contrary </s> <s> Thats true	So, even if they don't respond, just think they are driving or working, and try to avoid thinking that you are being ignored.

However, others struggle silently too, they just like you don't tell anyone

Yes, can you try organizing a virtual get together? </s> <s> I should try to organize something like that with my buddies too	At this point, only through video call.

I want to support you in any way I can, especially given your situation. Did you want to talk just to talk? Or we can discuss a way to work through what you might be dealing with mentally? It also sounds like keeping in touch with your cousin isn't helping in any way, so maybe we can talk about how to handle that? I am entirely at your disposal.

That's definitely difficult and it's easy to see why it wears on you so much. As much as you don't want to abandon her, it's important to remember to take care of yourself too. It's like when you're on a plane and the safety pamphlet tells you to put on your own oxygen mask before helping others with theirs. You might not be able to help your cousin as much as you want to if you are suffering too much. Are there any mental health resources you've tried for yourself other than reaching out here?

I see, it certainly doesn't help that it's difficult to keep in touch with your provider.

Well thats good to hear! Maybe you could ask one of them to coffee and express how you are feeling. I would bet that they felt the same when they started.
"This is a tough one. since starting a new job and being around really smart people and feeling that I can't really measure up anymore. I'm finding this really tough, I'm good at my job I'm very committed but I just don't seem to get the same results as
 others? </s> <s> I think what I do is so complicated I sometimes wonder if I've been off more than I can chew. is this something you can relate to?"	That certainly is something I can relate. There was a period of time in school where i signed up for way too many classes and had to drop out of a few. If you feel like you are in over your head it is ok to take a step back. It is important that you take care of your self and know your limits. :)
"I would say if you are showing signs for several weeks of being overwhelmed (tired, stressed, snappy etc.) That is probably is too much </s> <s> Thanks
he problem is I've worked really hard to get a better position and if I wasn't successful and feel like a failure. maybe I should look at it like this job just isn't for me if, like you say, I can't seem to get on after several weeks."	I would say thats the right option if this persists. I am sure there are other jobs that would fit you well!
that is certainly part of it however I also feel like they have more experience than me so maybe I'm just putting too much pressure on myself? </s> <s> Yes I suppose that is true actually. Just because I'm not good at this job, doesn't mean I wouldn't be great others. I suppose it's best to give it a go and see at least then you can say you tried. have you ever put too much pressure on yourself?	Yes i have and it did not end well I burned out and couldn't do my job at all.
Yes there are a few really nice co-workers </s> <s> Ah, so you have suffered with a similar situation. it is comforting to know the others face similar challenges and it's not just me	Of course you are not alone!
Yeah my long time partner cheated on me recently and I just found out </s> <s> I havent been able to see them in awhile because of lock down and now they tell me this :(	That is horrible I am so sorry they done that to you
its just been such a hard couple of months because of the virus </s> <s> And now with this I just dont know what to do	I have been cheated on in the past and it always messes with your mind just know it is nothing to do with you it is all them, yes this virus is horrible on everyone it took us all by surprise at how bad it is
When I got cheated on by my ex, I took time to build my self confidence up, build my happiness up, I wrote a letter telling him how it hurt and every feeling and then I ripped it up and threw it away it felt good getting my feelings out. it might help you to. </s> <s> What else do you think would help?	letting them go is the major one you don't ever want to be with someone who cheats on you if they do it once and you forgive them they 9 times out of 10 will do it again
letting them go is the major one you don't ever want to be with someone who cheats on you if they do it once and you forgive them they 9 times out of 10 will do it again </s> <s> They've hurt me too much and I wont be able to trust them again	exactly and once they break your trust it can't ever be fully repaired again you will always have that doubt in your mind about them
"I've not been doing great to be honest. I'm finding it hard to stay positive with all these constant lockdowns and 
restrictions </s> <s> Yes I suppose it does help to think it possible not for the long term but my friends seem to be dealing with it better than I am and I'm not quite sure why it's put me in such a sad emotional state. I should just get on with it but have very low motivation"	I have to say it's hard to find motivation and I was in that spot at the beginning.  With news of vaccines being introduced here shortly, that's what's keeping me afloat.  Are you able to hang out with friends?
"Maybe organizing a ""zoom party"" would start to lift your spirits. </s> <s> that's a really good suggestion. I could also catch up with friends that haven't seen for a while. I think this would definitely work to boost my mood. The only problem is being depressed isn't something that I'm familiar with. what if it goes a little bit deeper than this?"	Depression sucks I have to say!  Just don't let it win.  Since you say it's something you have never dealt with, you can fight it by staying upbeat and do something fun.
"Maybe organizing a ""zoom party"" would start to lift your spirits. </s> <s> Sure, or something conversations like this help perhaps a support group would be a good idea also?"	Start off by not being hard on yourself for feeling the way you do.  Music, tv and books does it for me - and zoom
"no not really because I'm not supposed to mix with people outside of my household. I could potentially try and meet them virtually online or on a video call is this something you've had much experience with? </s> <s> I've never heard of this,
 what is it?"	It's an app on mobile devices where you can (when there's no pandemic) meet up with folks who share common interests as yourself.  Nowadays instead of meeting in person, they are doing virtual meetups.  I do it with a book club.
Depression sucks I have to say!  Just don't let it win.  Since you say it's something you have never dealt with, you can fight it by staying upbeat and do something fun. </s> <s> I like the sound of that, thanks for your help	You are so welcome.  Just don't let that depression get the best of you.  You're stronger than it is.

It is always hard to hear any bad feedback, do you feel that you could speak with your manager about it and try to resolve the feelings? </s> <s> I could do but this seems to be something that she has an issue with and I wouldn't want it to damage our working relationship. She basically said she doesn't like the way I sit in meetings and smile when I'm thinking about something?	Could you possibly go to her and tell her that you have heard the feed back and you are sorry to hear that it bothers her that you did not realize it and it is something you will work on becoming more aware of.

I don't see how I sit in meetings or how I smile when I'm thinking to be constructive work based feedback it's really frustrating it's clear this person just doesn't like me	Going to another manager may be a great idea! Maybe the manager could address the issue with her and help her to realize there is nothing wrong with a having happy employee like yourself.

I think maybe I'm overthinking this but I've taken it very personally.	Well you have a right to feel how you do, everyone takes things differently. It would bother me but i would proably try to get to know her better to see why she has such a problem with others being happy, maybe she has some problems going on in her life and has no one to share these problems with if she is not happy it may come as a struggle to see others happy all the time.

Yes you are such a positive person that i think you being supportive will help open up communication, and yes you should make it known that she has said something that has affected you personally and in addressing it may help her not treat others that way in the future.
You seem like such a nice person i am sure if you approached it the right way you would not cause any damage. </s> <s> ok great I'll definitely try that and try and put this advice into practice	In the mean time try to not take it personally you really seem like a nice person so i dont think she meant to cause you any harm.
I've just been feeling down about school the last couple of months. </s> <s> and I'm kind of upset at my self for it	Oh I see. Yeah these times right now are really difficult to feel motivated and get things done, especially when a lot of school is online
I cant seem to be motivated and I really miss seeing all my buddies at school </s> <s> I haven't seen anyone in person other than my family since march :(	I get that 100%. It's also been really hard on me to not be able to see the people I'm close too. I don't live with family anymore, so I haven't seen my family for months either. So I understand where you are coming from.
Usually I find myself just cooped up inside my room doing the same routine over and over again. That can put us into depressive, unmotivated moods. The thing that started helping me the most, was changing that routine even a little bit. If I feel unmotivated, I like to change my surroundings! Usually for me, that means moving to the living room, or to the back porch. As silly as that sounds, it really helps to switch up where you are trying to get things done. </s> <s> I've picked up a couple hobbies and they definitely help keep me busy but with school and all I find I dont have a lot of time for them	Oh yeah that probably is taking a bit toll on you working in the basement. I definitely suggest moving to the living room every now and then just to feel that small change. :)

It's also really helpful to try and do new things if you are feeling unmotivated. Obviously that is difficult right now, but there are definitely things you can try! Like going on walks outside, or trying new little hobbies. I personally have tried out drawing and typing to help distract me when I am feeling overwhelmed </s> <s> and everythiung can go back to normal	Yes exactly. And yeah that will be so nice when we are finally able to leave again and feel normal. But unfortunately we can't wait around for that since it's so up in the air recently.

I then exhale slowly through my nose and repeat for about 10 minutes. It can be very calming.

I should be graduating in June. </s> <s> I registered for my classes for next semester but I think I should drop my minor. \	Okay gotcha. Well a couple tips I can offer you: If you do end up on probation, most courses offer a probation workshop you can go through. And if you graduate in June, it should finish in time for you! And I was also going to recommend taking fewer units. As much as it sucks, you can't overwhelm yourself with work. You need to be able to have a healthy and happy life that is separate from school in order to preform your best. Dropping your minor may be what is best for not only your grades, but your mental health
I also recommend making an educational plan. Although it can seem scary and long to see your goals directly laid out in front of you, it really helps with motivation </s> <s> I will definitely do that. I feel better hearing that it's okay to drop my minor. I felt like a failure when I considered it.	From talking with you so far, I can tell that you are stressed about this.

Where I live, we just had daylight savings so it gets dark around 5:30 PM and it feels like my days are just wasted	There are a few strategies you could use to combat that.  Personally, I try to soak in as much sunlight as possible before it goes down.  Sometimes that will mean moving your work space, maybe getting up earlier to have a cup of coffee in the sunrise, maybe it's scheduling breaks into your day where you specifically get some vitamin D.

Basically. This has happened for as long as I can remember, even back when I was a little kid. Any friend i've ever had has just used me for SOME gain. Whether that be boredom, money, or an emotional support pillow. I'm so sick of it. They'll literally ignore me for months and randomly text me for money. If i respond theyll read my messages then ignore me until they need money again. Or, they'll use me to throw alllll their problems onto me and never do the same for me.

So you feel under valued in your relationships because people tend to take advantage of you.

Some of them. The others I never even get a chance because they just ignore my existence anytime I try and reach out to talk.

Agreed. I just hope that one day I can meet people and form actual friendships with them </s> <s> I thought I did. My husband and I made a couple friends. Theyre a couple and so are we so we go on double dates but they seem more drawn to him.

Few months ago she picked a fight with another of our friend for no reason </s> <s> the baby will be months soon and no word from her	Sounds like she's having some issues and she's not happy and taking it out on you.  I'm sure that makes you feel like the bad person here.
"And for some reason when this happens she expects you to come crawling asking her what you did wrong when infact you did nothing. she would start recalling what happened 5years ago </s> <s> Its actually disgusting how a grown up continuously

I can tell that you care about this person as a friend, but you are worried that the way he thinks and talks may ruin that in a way. Make sure to let him know these concerns!

It caused a lot of issues in the relationships with our friends. She had a tendency to discuss issues over text and didn't like doing it in person. But we realized, the problem with that is that you can't tell the emotion behind messages on a screen. But once we talked in person, our issues were solved because we could hear the intended emotions behind what we were saying

I think you are right in that the ambiguity of social interaction online makes him more inclined to say extreme thinks, perhaps to get a reaction. The more I think about it, perhaps this could be an indication that there is something he is dealing with and may be lashing out.	Yes exactly. It sounds like he might have other reasonings behind his actions. And you guys talking to him as friends in person, would show him that you care and that he is in a safe environment. He doesn't need to be so extreme
Yes of course! I wish you the best in overcoming this hard time with your friend. I believe that you guys will be able to talk through it since it's a newer issue. :) </s> <s> I hope so too. Nice to talk to you and thanks again.	Of course! Have a good rest of your day
Not bad but I'm just getting fed up with work. working for a big corporate just bored me to tears. It's all I know and I feel trapped like I can't escape.

Here's a blunt question- what do you want to do about it? Do you think you want to get better at being happy in this job? Or work towards getting another job? </s> <s> That is a very good question. I hadn't thought  about it like that. I think I want to try something new and you have helped me realise this. I don't think I actually want to be happier in my current position.

So when I felt like we needed to break up, I was experiencing similar guilt that you are experiencing.
I want to reassure you, that doing what's best for you is what is most important! Your partner will understand this if they truly care for you.

That I do understand as well. This pandemic has made it hard for everyone. Are you a parent with any little ones by chance?
"So here is some information that I have in my files to help others during this time. There is self-help.org that is labeled as being a self help during these times. There is also websites that i used like offerup and PoshMark where I was able to start selling some of my belongings to constantly bring in funds. Also try to google ""How to become a first time business owner"" and see if any of this information helps you and your family. </s> <s> That is very helpful of you.I have been wandering all over the internet lost and not knowing where to find help from.I will definitely check this out and make good use of them.Did you also get any funds from anyone?"	"I know that it can be hard and frustrating during this time, but you have to remain focused for your family and stay strong because I am sure they look up to you. 
With myself I did have to go to a lot of friends and family, but my faith and my blessings came from God. Looking to him to help with your problems and actually listening to his words would really alleviate some of the stress that is so draining"
I agree that God is our ultimate guide and helper in all this.He will never forsake us no matter what.I will definitely turn to him at this time to seek for his guidance and with faith He will see me through. </s> <s> True,you have been very helpful and i appreciate you taking the time to talk to me	You are very welcome and I am glad that I was able to be here for you.
Well I was given a promotion at my job to take a supervisor position. The only thing that my supervisor needed from me was my 12th grade transcripts, and I'm having a hard time getting them. </s> <s> They have given me a total of 3 weeks and I wasn't able to accomplish it .So they had to go with someone else.	I understand that can be flustering. Have you tried contacting your school for help?

Have you tried contacting your school for help? </s> <s> I've done that but so many people look up to me and its just hard to for me to be there on a daily basis knowing that I had this big opportunity and that I want be able to fulfil.	Have you tried contacting your State or county board of education?

The good news is your coworkers will always look up to you even if you are not in the supervisor roll. </s> <s> Thats true in some aspect	You can still be a big influence to your coworkers without being in the supervisor roll.
I think if you spent some time being a mentor to some of your coworkers you would feel better about the situation. </s> <s> I believe that's the only positive part dealing with this situation,	Your coworkers obviously look up to you and would appreciate your leadership in mentoring.
I think if you spent some time being a mentor to some of your coworkers you would feel better about the situation. </s> <s> Ive been a mentor 3 years out of 3 1/2 years Ive been with company	Take this oppertunity to share your experience with your coworkers and reach out to your management for more training that is available to you.
Thats a good ideal ill think about doing that. Thanks for your advice </s> <s> Thats it have a blessed day	OK goodbye.
I've spoken to a therapist but it didn't help. I tried a help hotline online but they thought I was suicidal so they called the cops to check on me .. never doing that again lol. </s> <s> I don't know what to do	Yeah, it sounds like you aren't suicidal. Though I do have to check; have you had any thoughts or tendencies of suicide or self-harm?

I tried a help hotline online but they thought I was suicidal so they called the cops to check on me .. never doing that again lol. </s> <s> I just feel like I'll never be happy.	I understand. Can you provide any more information about your meeting with the therapist? You said talking to one didn't help, do you know why?
I guess it also didn't help because she seemed like she was just reading a script. She wasn't the greatest at making me feel cared about </s> <s> You're doing pretty good though haha	That makes sense and is completely natural. It's difficult sometimes to open up to a stranger that you don't completely know or might not trust. It definitely sounds frustrating that she seemed like she was reading from a script.
That's interesting. I know from experience that finding a good therapist is all about trial and error, unfortunately. It's important to find the right fit and I would definitely suggest looking for a new one. Do you know of anyone in your life, maybe a friend or family member, that has been to therapy that you would be comfortable getting a recommendation from? </s> <s> I think my closest friend has been to therapy. I could always ask her for a recommendation.	That sounds like a great idea! Remember to keep your friends close too. I know it can be tough when you feel as low as this, but it's important to have a good support system in addition to any therapy you might be receiving.
I think my closest friend has been to therapy. I could always ask her for a recommendation. </s> <s> My friends and I look out for eachother. I think they're a good help :)	That's great to hear! It really sounds like you can go to them for support and often being there for someone else can make us feel better too.
I think my closest friend has been to therapy. I could always ask her for a recommendation. </s> <s> This was a nice little chat! You should actually volunteer for a helpline haha	Aww that's so good of you to say!! I do want to confirm that you have a game-plan now, though. Remember to keep your friends close and to start looking for a new therapist if you haven't already. If you find one that's not the right fit it doesn't hurt to start over or maybe even ask for a recommendation from that therapist. If they're any good they should understand how important it is for you to find a good fit. Also remember to be kind to yourself. It can be difficult, but I know you can do it.

"It has been around 4 months now. It started slowly and now has ramped up to where it's exploding and causing discourse among us all. One of my friends told a secret to another acquaintance outside of our group. </s> <s> My friend
 is raging over this which she should. trust was broken."	It sounds like tempers are all running pretty hot for everyone right now, is that correct?
"My friend
 is raging over this which she should. trust was broken. </s> <s> I believe in forgiveness, and the friend that told is very remorseful
How do I help them?"	Well, it sounds like you are in a tough spot since both your friends are so mad at each other.
The acquaintance knew something of the secret because she had experienced this before. I think my friend was more-so trying to help my other friend, not betray her. </s> <s> She went outside the group but not for spitrful reasons i think.	I think I understand. Sometimes we accidentally hurt the people we love when we are trying to help.
The acquaintance knew something of the secret because she had experienced this before. I think my friend was more-so trying to help my other friend, not betray her. </s> <s> How do I make her understand this?	I think it is great that you want to actively help, it says a lot about you.
The acquaintance knew something of the secret because she had experienced this before. I think my friend was more-so trying to help my other friend, not betray her. </s> <s> Thanks! What should I say to her?	Sometimes the best way to help someone understand is to give them a little time and space. Trying to force someone to understand doesn't always work.
I want one friend to know that the other was trying to hel and nothurt, but did not think clearly when deciding where to get help from. </s> <s> I think I will tell everyonr in our circle to fall back and let her come to us when she is ready.	You could also try talking to your hurt friend like this and ask her if she thinks the other friend truly meant to hurt her. I bet she knows that wasn't the case.
But you have to consider that there are dozens of different reasons why you don't get selected for a job, and quite a few of them have nothing to do with you , either as a person or as an employee. </s> <s> Thank you for that, it seems most of the jobs I am applying for I am over qualified for which doesn't make sense to me and makes me think it is something personal about me.	No, don't think that.  I know of several employers that have actually said they don't want employees smarter than them.  It requires more money and more management, and quite a few people are very happy to not do either of those things for ostensibly higher quality workforce.
You should explore what resources your city/county/province may offer for job seekers.  It is in the best interest of almost every community that its members have have jobs and feel useful, so you may find some valuable information and maybe some connections. </s> <s> Thank you so much for talking, I feel so much better already and this was great adivce.	I was in a similar situation, nothing was ever good enough, and we were never given enough information to succeed anyhow.
Thank you so much for talking, I feel so much better already and this was great adivce. </s> <s> I'm sorry you had to experience something similar by the sounds of it you are no longer in that situation, so that gives me hope for myself!	That is awesome :-)
I'm just really lonely. My friends are all very busy lately and I haven't been able to find a partner for a long time. </s> <s> Yes. Normally it's not so bad but it's been such going on for such a long time. It's harder to deal with after so many years.	It sounds like you feel your friends are too busy for you.
I'm just really lonely. My friends are all very busy lately and I haven't been able to find a partner for a long time. </s> <s> Yes, but the biggest part is not being able to find romantic partner.	Why do you think you are having trouble finding a suitable romantic partner?
Part because of my low income and part because of my age. I live in a college town and most single women are 10 years younger than me. </s> <s> I've tried but my friends don't have very large social circles and most mutuals are already dating or are not interested in dating anyone at all.	I can see how that would make it difficult. What about internet dating or going to a single's night?
I can see how that would make it difficult. What about internet dating or going to a single's night? </s> <s> Internet dating is a cost issue, the most popular apps charge to meet the person, I could look at singles nights once the Covid issue is over. I don't even know if there are any locally.	It seems Covid is making dating difficult for everyone.

I wish I had Covid as an excuse instead of just being confused about why I can't find someone.	It is reasonable to use Covid as an excuse. I am sure there are plenty of women out there who are also confused about why they can't find someone.

Hello. I am so broken up and also disgusted from my break-up with my only long-term partner. </s> <s> I was so surprised by the hurtful things he said when we broke up I just don't know how to even manage my feelings about all the time we spent together.	I am so sorry to hear that. I know how that feels.
Well, I suppose for him it came out of nowhere. But for me I just had slowly come to the realization that he was not the person for me. I fell out of love with him slowly and grew more annoyed by a lot of his behaviors. </s> <s> So, I am sure he felt attacked and unattractive and so he lashed out at me.	Realizing someone isn't the same you fell in love with seems valid. Fighting over a salad is definately not something most couples argue over.
"I think I did the right thing, not just for me but for him. It isn't fair to keep dating someone just because being single is hard. 
I just still get weird lingering feelings wondering if he was right and maybe I am too much for a lot of people. I don't think he is right, and my friends disagree but it still hurts and I can still hear him tell me no one would ever love me. </s> <s> No, I don't think I have any regrets."	I think I have said the same thing in a breakup so I wouldn't take that personal.

Hopefully someone who doesn't fight over whether salad is valid dinner choice!	Perhaps if you set up a dating profile have that be an intro question: is a salad a meal? you can weed people out that way!!!!

Well, I am retired, but in need of extra income to meet my financial obligations.  It is very difficult for me, however, to wear a mask for longer than a few moments.  Due to the mandates in my area, I would be required to wear a mask. </s> <s> That is what I am currently doing, and it is helping some.  I have increased the time I work on there, so that will help some.  I would love a second source as well, however...just so I could really save some.	I hear you on that. I am disabled and the extra income helps a lot for my family. Unfortunately until the pandemic ends a part time job might not be in your best interest for now. Ebay flipping takes some time to get into as well but could help.
It can be bit tough to get into in the beginning, but with a decent amount of work and determination it might be able to help with your monetary problems. </s> <s> Yes, I have thought of that, actually.  I have quite a few items I would love to sell.  I have never done it, though, so need to research how to ship items, etc.	Its actually very easy now. You can print out the slips at home and they tell you how much it will be. I have done it a few times, the last time was only a couple months a go.
It can be bit tough to get into in the beginning, but with a decent amount of work and determination it might be able to help with your monetary problems. </s> <s> Well, I will definitely have to check that out.  It would serve two purposes : decluttering and making money.  I think I got anxious last week when I had a tire go flat and took my car in to get it fixed.  I found out I need all new tires and new brakes.  Not easy on a fixed income.  Plus I am widowed.	I am sorry for that. Yea having a nest egg is ideal, but i know how hard it can be. I think with the extra cash and space it may be a big help to those anxiety issues. Do you drive a lot as it is now?

It wouldn't hurt to try, I guess.	Believe me never hurts to try. A penny you save on something else can be a penny that goes into your savings

That's really great! Having a good support system is important right now. I understand it's difficult to find a job during these times.
Have you tried looking for an online only - remote position? Like some administrative work? </s> <s> Any ideas on where to look?	Where are you looking for jobs right now? Some of my friends have had some success by looking on LinkedIn or Idealist.

I'm an introvert / homebody so it's been fairly easy for me. I have a lot of projects at home that I enjoy doing (reading, puzzles, meditating, yoga, etc) that keep me busy. I was also, very lucky to be able to keep my full-time job so that keeps me fairly busy most days. But I like a change of scenery and do Mturk tasks for fun </s> <s> I do to and plus it gives u extra cash	yes! not a whole lot honestly, but i like it.

Yes, I am a little more than halfway done with the semester </s> <s> The thing is that I am in a doctoral program, so even though the semester is close to the end, I always need to continue working	Ahh, I see.  That is a great deal of time and work.  What are you studying?
Yes, I am a little more than halfway done with the semester </s> <s> I have to work on my thesis on the side even with all of my classes and I have a hard time managing my time and keeping track	Time management can be very difficult with a normal class load, that sounds exhausting.
Also, setting clear boundaries for your study/work and relax times may help.  I like to set a timer for, say, 45 minutes, and work/write/read/study for that long, then, I get a 10 minute break.  I'll go outside, refresh my coffee, grab a snack, dance to some music, stretch, then set another timer for 45 minutes, then another break for 10 minutes.  That allows my brain to take a second and refresh from the work. </s> <s> I think it would help to fix break times so I can actually focus on working	"Or, like, today, I woke up and spent half an hour allowing myself to drink my coffee and scroll through Reddit.  Then it was time to work on my group project for 45 minutes, then a break, then I worked again, took a break, went to a class, etc.  Scheduling your breaks can be helpful too so your lizard brain doesn't freak out and go ""WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING FOREVERRRR"""
That is actually very helpful, I'll take note of it </s> <s> I agree!!! That really is helpful, thank you	which, for me at least, is where the fatigue sets in.  You're very welcome!

I've also been turning to drugs a lot lately due to the situation. Procrastinating makes me feel guilty, and I end my day too early to smoke and focus my mind on something other than studying....

And working from home is infamously hard, again, for lack of boundaries, so in addition to just not seeing people and getting the casual affirmation and confirmation messages on a daily basis of like ""hey Jim you did a great job on that spreadsheet"" or ""Haha Jessica you're so funny"", we also are writing papers in our pajamas and bedclothes, which makes it seem interminable."
I'm always locked in my apartment and staying sitting down in front of my computer all day </s> <s> Ugh exactly	Listening to lectures while the doorbell is ringing and it's just so strange and we aren't set up to do it.  That's why I'm a big fan of specific spaces in my house since March.  I tried to sit in bed with my laptop and do things but 1. I'm old and it hurts my wrists and 2. my headspace is so completely different from being my computer chair and at my desk.  I try to be really strict about where I do my work., maybe trying to structure that a bit could help you feel a little more in control of the work load and your day's schedule.

Oh i see, well i think overthinking things like that can lead to unwanted emotions. Or putting yourself in a situation with another person when you are in a relationship might mean there are other issues going on. </s> <s> Yes i see that. No nothing else going on just thinking that the definition maybe shouldn't be as exact for the type of person that I do not talk to because of his reservations about it.	Well, if you are not talking to them then i see no harm. If you are talking to them with some sort of intention to for a relationship beyond friendship then i see issues arising.
That is what I feel. I am not talking to him. I had to the other day to get in contact with someone(medical emergency) but do not call just to chat and catch up. I even unfriended him.

The company I work for is winding down. i'm on the old side to be looking for a job and i'm likely going to have to accept a lower salary, a longer commute and a heavier workload. In other words, I have a job I love, close to where I live that is very manageable. I can't sleep and I'm insanely anxious all of the time. </s> <s> I started looking for a job last week.

I've got a jigsaw puzzle that I could start, and I also have a list of ""21 books that you've been meaning to read."" </s> <s> If I start working through the 21 books, that should keep me going for quite a while (even if I'm not interested in all of them)!"

I've been better. I have to give a presentation at work on a stage. This is causing me a lot of stress and problems sleeping </s> <s> I have learned my lines and practiced at home a lot. I know what to say almost word for word but I had a bad experience in the past that has scared me.	I understand giving presentations is nervewrecking, but at least you are trying. Are you allowed to take a few notecards just in case?
It is the thought of getting nervous in front of people and forgetting what I want to say. </s> <s> Thanks for understanding, yeah I suppose I could take notes. I think it is being in front of people and looking foolish that I'm scared of the most. I know a lot of people at work and don;t want them to think I'm bad on stage. Can you related to that?	I can definitely relate. It is best to look past the audience and just focus on an object close by. Everyone of us have had to experience this. You are not alone.
Hopefully I can try to get past the nerves, some people make it look easy. I'm usually really confident but something about standing on a stage makes me feel very scared and anxious. </s> <s> I could do I suppose. I won't be the only one presenting that day so I feel like I won't be able to measure up against the other people on stage.	Try shifting the focus on what could go wrong, to what could go right? Focus on others congratulating you on a job well done.

I'm not feeling great. I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me. </s> <s> She has started a new job and I think she might have met someone at work that she likes better than me. I can't believe she is doing this to me!	Ok so it seems like you are quite angry at the moment at the thought of her with someone else, is that true?
She has started a new job and I think she might have met someone at work that she likes better than me. I can't believe she is doing this to me! </s> <s> Yes I suppose it is true. The thing is I thought things were going well and she is stressed out at work with her new job but we were getting on great!	I had a similar experience myself. My partner was stressed and I was busy myself. It turns out that I wasn't paying him enough attention and this made him feel like I didn't think he was important to me any more.

It is but that is a lot of change all happening at once.

Yes, I think so although I don't have any proof. Things were going really well and then all of a sudden she text me and told me things aren't working. </s> <s> I still think there is someone else that has come between us.	Have you got any evidence of this like seen a text message or has she behaves strangely?

It is but that is a lot of change all happening at once. Perhaps she is getting a little bit scared and rather than dealing with the situation she is running away, perhaps you should talk about this and see how she responds? </s> <s> So do you think I should try and talk to her and ask her outright if she has met someone else?	I think rather than ask her that question directly, you could start the conversation and ask her why she is feeling this way. This would show you care and are prepared to listen without jumping to conclusions.

I'm sad and angry because I no longer talk to my best friend </s> <s> Well she was staying at my house for a month and we were constantly fighting so she just stopped talking to me	That sounds really stressful and I can see how troubling that is for you.
Well she was staying at my house for a month and we were constantly fighting so she just stopped talking to me </s> <s> Yes it is and then she began avoiding me while we were in the same house, so we started arguing again and I found out she's been lying to me since I've known her and I'm very upset.	That's definitely very upsetting. I know how it feels to have that sense of betrayal from a friend I was close to for many years. However, I was able to discuss the issue I had with my parents and other friends. Do you have anyone else close to you that you can talk to?
I'm sad and angry because I no longer talk to my best friend </s> <s> I don't think so, my parents think I was too harsh by deciding to end the friendship, it as if my own family doesn't understand.

It's important to find support in your other friends and heal properly."

Yes, I also realized that I wasn't angry with my friend but rather myself </s> <s> I feel like I was stupid to do that and soft	"If I may, I would argue that your actions don't make you soft and they certainly don't make you stupid. They are certainly not any reason to be angry with yourself. If I may bring up another cliché: ""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."" I would say you're in the ""fool me once"" stage and it is your friend's actions that have brought you pain. I think you're unlikely to trust her again."

And it's hard where everyday is the same for me and staying at home, without a change of pace like even simple walks outside, going to the gym, or going to hike or run etc. I pretty much missed out the whole year after March. My life has been on hold and I am just surprised that it's even november now, because it feels like I am still stuck in March. </s> <s> and also feeling guilty to see myself waste my life and time this way and not being productive	I can rephrase some of this, if you don't mind. In a way, you're talking about activities that you may have used (gym, hikes, etc) to keep yourself in a good mood. Now that those don't seem available, you just don't have those opportunities to boost your mood. It makes sense that you would be feeling this way.
I go out pretty much only when I have a purpose and personal admin/errands. I work about one or two days a week out of my home. So with the rising cases, I just feel anxious having to get out of the safety of my home. I was a lot more anxious earlier this year though. I am much more used to it at this time. </s> <s> now I am more used to it of course, but this summarizes how I have been feeling for most of this year.	I think you explained yourself really well. Thanks for sharing how you've been feeling.
yes you're right. That's exactly it. I think it's going to be this way for a long time. I see other people compromising and taking the risk to go out for walks or runs, and even to the gym. I could have done that for the last few months when we had zero cases for awhile, but I didn't want to gamble and compromise. And I still see those people as selfish when I choose to do what I think is right. </s> <s> yeah no worries. It's good that you understand and thank you for listening.	Do you think if you went ahead anyway to the gym or out for runs that you would feel guilty for doing them?

As in, thinking that situations or people are completely good or completely bad? Or completely doable or completely impossible?"
so in my opinion, I feel a little indignant at the people that have been going out frivolously like there's nothing going on, to even gamble their safety and their family's. Like I live in an apartment building, and the people around me and below me are always going out, even for the last few months. So I don't feel safe either but also indignant that others are doing what I could have done, but that I had compromised on for my safety and everyone else's safety. So I just didn't feel it was fair for them to do that when I could have done that anytime I wanted. </s> <s> for this pandemic, it's pretty much black and white	Yeah, I think I understand that too. I get really frustrated hearing about people hosting big parties or not wearing masks because they think it's no big deal. They're putting others at risk.
Because I either go out or I don't. I have to compromise my values and everything I worked hard to preserve for the last few months to go out, even if I put on extra protection etc. And I just rigidly refuse to compromise my values because I don't believe it's right. Because if I had done that, I would have done that already, and long ago. And even though it's really hard on me. </s> <s> But anyhow, that's the situation in a nutshell.	I think we all do black-or-white thinking to some extent. We're wired to try and make sense of the world, and maybe our brains don't like to spend time on nuance and grey areas. We all tend to quickly categorize things into good or bad, easy or hard, black or white.
and also feeling guilty to see myself waste my life and time this way and not being productive </s> <s> But anyhow I am good to go then. Thank you so very much for understanding and for your valuable inputs.	"Does this time have to be a ""waste"" for you? With no productivity? That seems pretty extreme."
"and also feeling guilty to see myself waste my life and time this way and not being productive </s> <s> well I do a lot of ""waste"" at home. So I am quite sluggish and lazy and lost at home."	Thanks for saying that! I liked talking with you, and we can wrap this up. I guess I'm saying you sound thoughtful and intelligent, I'm confident that you could find ways to get more out of this time if that's what you're wanting to do.
and also feeling guilty to see myself waste my life and time this way and not being productive </s> <s> I was thinking this also that even though this is a very tough time, we will look back on this about years from now, and say wow, we got through all that!

Have you ever explored medication?

You should definitely see if the doctor can adjust your meds, I have ended up on a completely different type of medication than the one I tried first.  But I understand.  I think you should try getting out of the house and enjoying fresh air and physical activity.  It won't cure your depression but it may help your headspace and your point of view.

Booze does this crazy thing where we think it's making things easier, but it's really making things 10x harder.  10x harder to process emotions, 10x harder to find the motivation, 10x harder to believe you are worth the effort to keep moving.

I am trying hard but I have been having a tough time, especially now that I have been searching for a new place to live.	I remember a bad breakup too where I wasn't sure how the future would go.

She is black and I’m white. It was tough on the relationship. </s> <s> I know but our synergy was amazing. I miss her so much. That skin drove me crazy!	Getting over the good parts of a relationship can be hard.

That is deep.  I just need to do things to get my mind off of her. </s> <s> That’s a good idea. I might do yoga too.	Know also that you will find someone new when it's right, and that you will create a new synergy with that new person.  We don't ever love anyone the same way twice.

That's true and divorce can be expensive. You mentioned before that you feel like you are with him mostly because you are lonely, is that how your relationship started?
I do worry a lot.  If he would commit fully to me that would help perhaps.  If he never cheated again but I don't know if he can do that reliably. </s> <s> That's a good point you make.

Well studies show that if you continuously think negatively, than that is how your life will be lived.

Being alone is a tough situation, but you can take care of your brain and your heart by giving them a break from the chaos
Being alone is a tough situation, but you can take care of your brain and your heart by giving them a break from the chaos </s> <s> You are right. I think I will just focus on me and my mental health.	You have an awesome attitude, I know you can do it :-)
Foster the people around you that can provide you support, be a reliable producer and leader, and you will find that those that don't like you will move on.  And, most importantly, you can only control how you respond/behave.  If someone wants to instigate conflict, that will reflect poorly upon them. </s> <s> So avoid them if they get hostile with me?	You can only engage with what abuse and hostility you accept.  If you smile in response, it will make you feel better than if you internalize their aggression.
Good idea. I thought about dating again. Do you think it is too soon? </s> <s> True.	I think you are the only person who can decide when you are ready to start dating again, but I would encourage you to try to keep it light and casual at first.

Casual dating is a good idea. Don’t want to get attached right now.	Strengthen yourself and your boundaries and pursue your interests.  I got into boxing and it's a great way to get in shape and have an emotional release.
Thanks. I’m trying to keep myself busy. Any suggestions? </s> <s> I took up running and yoga. I stopped going to the gym. What else did you do?	I rehabbed a bunch of my houseplants.  I had some really sad looking pothos plants and I started reading about how to revitalize them.

Yes that has been a big stressor for many. I sometimes find myself having trobule to fall asleep. So I make sure my room is dark and think about something relaxing. </s> <s> I think my problem is I think too much :-(	no tv, cell phones etc. a hot shower before bed might help.

When you can not shut your mind down it will prevent you from thinking and so I will actually to clear my head just think of something relaxing or enjoyable. </s> <s> okay	sometimes white noise helps or the sounds of frogs on an app idk why but that works for some people too. The important thing is find something that works and relaxes your mind from thinking too much if you can.

I am doing what I love to do most which is helping others because it makes me feel better to help others if I can. </s> <s> That's good to hear.

Really am not feeling well, am not able to handle my stress </s> <s> covid 19	It sounds to me like COVID-19 in general is causing you a lot of stress. Does this sound accurate to you?
yes moreover i am living alone, for my job and needs i need to take care of myself </s> <s> But when i see social media and News every day it increasing my stress level	I live alone as well and also need to take care of myself. It can be so hard at times.
I found that spending less time on social media and less time watching the news has helped my anxiety level to an extent. I don't think you should completely stop listening to what's going on as it's important to stay informed, but for me, limiting the amount of time that I spend engaging in these activities really helped. </s> <s> there is not much option now i can't go out also	Have you considered spending your time engaging in other hobbies? I've been doing a lot of arts and crafts (one in particular called diamond painting that can be ordered directly from Amazon) and also reading novels that I can also have delivered right to my door. This also prevents me from having to go out in public.
Thanks that was good idea better keep away myself from social media for a while </s> <s> thanks for your support	You're welcome! I'm more than happy to provide any help that I can. I'd also very highly recommend finding hobbies that you enjoy, even if arts and crafts or reading aren't your thing. Can you think of anything else that would help you to keep your mind off everything going on?

They don’t agree with the girl I have been dating. </s> <s> Because of her race. She is black.	I can see why you would be upset about that. So, that is the only reason they don't approve.

It was in highschool I dated a black man after I became an adult they didn't say much about who I dated and I countinued to date the person and it ended when he went in the miltary and I went to college not at first but it was the distance thing.

Yeah. We still live together but I am working on moving out </s> <s> My best friends support me in this and know what I am going through. It's just really painful	It is understandable to feel that way. I agree it's best to move out, you won't be able to move on if you still see each other. Have you considered seeing a therapist?
Did you talk to your friends about this? Maybe they can offer some advice as they know you best </s> <s> I am working on that too after I move out.

I guess we're done	Oh yeah, Kendrick is awesome and makes actual meaningful music.  Kanye also is super talented, sadly he seems to have his issues, but don't we all!
I think that is definitely one way to look at it. But another way to look at your situation is you figured out a therapist who isn't worth seeing. That brings you one step closer to finding one who does actually help you. All you need to do now, is do some research and find someone who has your best interest in mind. Believe me, there are great therapists and terrible therapists. You just need to find one of the good ones now. </s> <s> I'm not sure I can find another who I don't have to pay. My insurance has a $20 copay and if I had to pay that I wouldn't be able to buy groceries. This came through my religious organization and he was the only one available in my area. I guess I just have to find another way to cope	If you have financial issues and you need the help from a therapist you deserve the treatment. One thing you can do is apply for Medicaid and EBT. The state you live in will give you money to pay for groceries and to get help from a therapist for free if you don't have a high enough income. It may be worth looking into because all you really need to do is fill out some forms and likely you will be approved. When I was younger and struggling, this had happened to me and I received both of these benefits and it totally turned my life around. I think it can do the same for you as well.

He said that's not what a therapist is supposed to do and that my resistance shows I don't really want to change.	I can see how that comment he made would be frustrating. If you feel like vaping, you should continue to do; however, what happens if say you go somewhere and find yourself in a stressful position? What would be strategy you could use in order to recenter yourself? Strategies are important as they balance us when we experience stressors that through us off.

Me personally, I like to scour youtube and find an environment with a sound I enjoy such as the beach. When I listen to that sound, I try to put myself by closing my eyes while sitting on the floor and breathing deeply for some time. It may be worth a try for you. I hope it helps you. Good luck!

Try having a private conversation with her and don't ask her to talk to him, merely push her in that direction. It's less plotting and more seeing her point of view as well.

That way, you have some common ground to work with. </s> <s> I'm honestly not sure, I guess I've always been too nervous to reach out to anyone. I'll have to have a look.	That sounds like a good idea =) Even if you can't hold club meetings on campus or have any gatherings, maybe they hold their meetings over video calls. One plus side to that, is that you don't need to have your camera on to participate.
Very true, this year made everyone's expectations and plans go out the window lol </s> <s> That's true. I also feel a bit nervous about my final grades, I've done well so far but just feel like this year might mess everything up.	That's understandable, especially with how the past year has been.

Lately, I've been focusing on self care a lot more to help with de stressing with everything going on. Have you tried this? </s> <s> I haven't tried that, I'll have to try something similar. I haven't been focusing on self care at all recently	Self care is so important even when there isn't a pandemic. It can help you connect with yourself and make you feel less overwhelmed and just give you YOU time. Some of my favorite ways to do this is listening to podcasts, meditating and focusing on my breathing, listening to music, and pamper myself with face masks etc.
I suggest you practice self care starting once a week and work it up from there giving yourself at least an hour a day if you can </s> <s> I appreciate you recommending that I spend an hour a day. I think something like this could better myself into living a much happier and fulfilled life.	"I suggest listening to Jay shetty he is on most podcasts apps. personally, I use stitcher.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! There is so many great books out there and other podcasts as well about self care.

I truly am thankful for speaking with you today :)	I'm so glad I was able to help. Enjoy the rest of your day and remember to set aside sometime for yourself. It was great chatting with you.
I have to agree with you-it is unacceptable, considering that he didn't give me any reasons as to why he did it. We have been together for 5 years. </s> <s> It is still rather raw,I have mentioned to it to a few of my friends and they deeply symphatise with me but I feel there is nothing much they can do to help me.They are as shocked as me to be honest.	It is understandable to have that reaction. I agree with you, only us can hep ourselves.
Have you tried doing activities that help distract you from having negative thoughts? </s> <s> Kind of, most of it involves eating loads of ice cream LOL.	Haha I feel you, I tend to eat a lot when depressed too. Look, it's treat yourself method. You deserve the best
If you can go to the mountain or big lake, I would say try spending a few hours there. Maybe have a mini picnic by yourself and enjoy the nature. </s> <s> It surely would help me to clear my mind	Is there anything you have wanted to do but don't have the time? I always want to learn guitar and baking. This is the best time to start that
oh yeah, I suppose I have more time now to focus on things I have always wanted to do but never kind of had time for it. I bought a high end photo camera ages ago but never really had a chance to use it properly-I guess it is time to pursue my interest in photography, and spending more time outdoors would be ideal for that! </s> <s> And reading! The list of books I want to read is arm long!	That's the spirit! I know being treated like that feels horrible. However, I bet you have mourned enough, at the end of the day, a person treats you like that has no respect and you shouldn't waste time on them.
Haha I feel you, I tend to eat a lot when depressed too. Look, it's treat yourself method. You deserve the best </s> <s> Who said you cannot have the cake and eat it all LOL	Yes!Actually don't think you did wrong. Reflecting after a relationship is good but don't put all the blame on yourself.
I guess the problem is that I am faced with impending deadlines with my studies, and that I am not that great with my organization or time management, and compounded with distractions. </s> <s> So I don't know if you have any tips or personal experiences on how to deal with such issues	By any chance have you thought about trying out some time management class?
No, because time management I feel is something that I have to resolve on my own, and I have enough courses on my plate right now. </s> <s> But I guess for time management, I tend to be distracted easily or spend too long on other stuff outside of my studies	Oh ok I see. I have actually been in this type of situation before, and I took those classes and they actually helped.

Find out where your wasting you time? Try creating time management goals?

While your studying play some soft music in the background that you like and see if that helps.

Probably about 3 months ago. </s> <s> My kids started online learning in their respective rooms during the day. One day they both came running to me after about 3 days of school asking me for various things that kids do. They were only coming to me and my husband sort of participated in the beginning but now he is falling back the last few months and it has taken a toll on our relationship.	"Correct me if I'm wron
g, your children are now online learning, and you are feeling defeated because your husband is pulling away and not providing you the support you need?"
Yes, but he seemingly will not compromise. </s> <s> He tried to suggest a half and half deal or this time im here for them and this time he is. He is not holding up to his promises.	That makes it hard when you have already tried to take the steps to help you improve the situation. If I may offer a suggestion, perhaps you should approach him, and advise him you are not interested in arguing since that won't improve the situation, but be up-front and honest about how this is making you feel, and how his lack of support will ultimately harm the whole family. And also maybe ask him if there is anything going on with him to find out why his support to you, and the children has changed.

Hello my name is Christina </s> <s> Hello Christina	What's your name?
I am feeling depressed. I feel lonely and unimportant to those around me. </s> <s> I just want to get out of this slump. I hate that im sad all the time	I can understand that.  If I may can I ask you if you live with anyone?
Ok well that should be something that you can take pride in.  Do you have contact with your friends and family?  I have found that for me calling my mom or chatting with my friends that truly know me makes me feel more connected to others. </s> <s> I talk to my mom often, but i was isolated from most of my friends for years so im trying to meet new ones.	That's great that you speak to your mom.  I know it can be hard to open yourself up and meet new friends but I think you can do it.  Are there maybe some people at your job that you would consider making friends with?  I think that would be a great place to start because you would already have something in common.
I talk to my mom often, but i was isolated from most of my friends for years so im trying to meet new ones. </s> <s> I do have friends from my job, but i currently commute 1.5 hours for work which makes it hard. I feel that with time i may be more open to more friends, but right now i just want those that already know my back story for comfort.	OK I see.  So for now you would like to be able to get comfort from the people that already know you and your story.  One suggestion that I have would be to really try to reach out and contact those people.  I know that with work and life in general it is easy to lose touch.  Not that you stop caring for a person but things just get hetic from time to time.
I am here to talk about the effects that the current pandemic has on my mental health. </s> <s> Specifically, I feel scared and anxious that me, my friends, or my loved ones will be infected	That is very understandable. I too have felt this anxiety.
"I see. Sorry to hear that. I don't go out until it's absolutely necessary, only when I have errands or for work. And so for more than half a year, I have not gone out for any frivolous walks, to the movie theatre, for hikes, or to workout 
s I used to. </s> <s> There's no coherent or healthy lifestyle pattern, as my life pretty much was put on hold from back in March."	Well, it sounds like you are doing pretty well given the circumstances. It is good that you have found activities to keep busy.
It was freeing at first, but then I realized that it was going to repeat perpetually and that I was going to miss the entire summer, etc. </s> <s> yeah that's a good idea.	I have a good feeling that we will have some normalcy by summer 2021
I understand. As long as you are being cautious and following the guidelines, you are doing all you can to protect yourself. That is a good thing. </s> <s> yes I am trying to be as careful and not think to much as I can.	Just taking it one day at a time and focusing on the positives.
I think you are doing the right thing. And it shouldn't be long before the vaccine is released. </s> <s> Yeah the highly publicized vaccine company is hopefully going to roll out its vaccine soon in the States.	That's promising. Just make sure you are getting your vitamins, and drinking plenty of water. This will keep your immune system strong. It's difficult to remember to take care of yourself when all this is going on.
yes, I get enough of those. Just should have more of a routine, as you said before. I just need to manage my time better at home and also find more time to work out and sleep at normal times, because I tend to sleep real late nowadays. </s> <s> That's exactly right, I kind of ignore myself and became zoned out or something.	Sleeping patterns can vary. Some studies actually show that certain people are better off with an unpredictable routine. Just listen to your mind and body.
Just taking it one day at a time and focusing on the positives. </s> <s> But aside from that, I should be fine then. Thank you very much for your helpful input.	You are welcome. Thank you for allowing me to try to help!

He has, and yes I've told him, he just dismisses it, thinks it's funny that I get jealous </s> <s> That's good advice! Thanks. I wonder how I can get through to him to really let him know I'm serious. Ideas?	I have been in the same situation myself, what I usually do is sit down with them and start the conversation in a serious mood. Explain everything I need to say and tell them that I mean every word. If they don't seem to accept and change, I keep my distance from them
He has, and yes I've told him, he just dismisses it, thinks it's funny that I get jealous </s> <s> Right, so basically let him know if he continues to act like he does, we're done as friends, correct? Or should I not be that bold?	Yes. Be not too harsh at first. I would say to give him 1 more chance. If he still doesn't respect your words, it's the best for both to say it clearly.
What I would recommend in this case is, spend more time with other friends who appreciate you. You also need to tell Rick your honest thought, don't beat around the bush but let him know you're serious </s> <s> Suggestions welcome! :)	You have the right mindset! Practice before talking will help you deliver your thoughts better.

What do you consider to be a minor reward that would be a good tool for me today? </s> <s> I have created a list and was able to check one thing off already. This has helped some and I feel a little more relieved.	"A punch card. If you have one handy, a note card/index card. Draw maybe, 15 circles around the edge, and call it ""My rewards"" In the middle, choose one thing you enjoy, for instance, if you like an ice cream sundae, put that in the middle. For your first task, just jot all that is on your mind down, and also use that as the first task to yourself. Check off one circle, and once you hit 15 get that sundae!"

A walk alone somewhere pretty tends to be a refreshing, zen-like activity. Or even, as a meditation type approach, rock stacking. It takes much focus, and tends to leave your mind clearer in the end. I also recommend reading, or listening to audio books of a theme you are interested in. It brings comfort in activities

My mother passed away about a month ago due to alcoholism, it has been rough attempting to cope with the many different emotions. </s> <s> I'm so sorry that it's a situation that you can relate to, its such a hard situation watching someone drink their life away no matter what you do until they eventually pass away from it. I can say my anxiety has increased immensely as well as depression. It seems that quite a bit of pressure has been placed on me because of the family business she ran and my dad who is now trying to live without her.	Wow, that really is a lot to deal with. It seems as though you have a good understanding of what you're feeling but that you are trying to figure out how to move forward from here. It seems like you are trying to figure out how to work through your feelings as well as how to manage and deal with the pressure that has been put on you as a result. Does that sound accurate to you?

Have you considered any ways in which you could start to work through what you're feeling? </s> <s> Yes, I have begun a new medication that will hopefully help soon, I have also begun focusing on different hobbies that I enjoy so that I can keep my mind busy.	It's great to hear that you are on a medication that will hopefully help you. Have you also considered speaking to an outpatient therapist or someone along those lines? That way, you could return to the same person as often as you feel necessary to continue to work through your feelings with someone who isn't directly involved with your situation.

I enjoy being able to use my hands and become proud once i finish an accomplishment.	I completely agree. I used to see a therapist. It was very difficult for me to do in the beginning, but once I got to know them, they provided me with coping strategies that otherwise, I never would have thought of. One of my favorites that he introduced me to was guided meditation. Have you ever heard of it?

Anything really. I have two kids, neither of which is in school yet so they're with me all the time. It's very rare that I have someone to watch them for me so I can do....anything by myself. One of my good friends got married recently and my parents watched them for me so I could go to her bachelorette party and wedding without them. That was the first time I'd gone anywhere without them in....over a year </s> <s> I did. I had a really good time. It was weird being out without them, but it was fun	Nice! Well, two kids is A LOT, especially since they aren't in school yet. You are dealing with the care and growth of the most complex organism on this planet...times two! That's incredible. First of all, give yourself a pat on the back for that. Secondly, is it ok if i ask if you felt guilty for having fun without them? Often times guilt robs us of the ability to take care of ourselves, which happens to me all the time.
It's a combination of things. I have no idea what I'm doing most days, just kind of going through the motions. Kind of like Groundhog Day, repeating the same day over and over with slightly different variations. Trying to get things done and taken care of, thinking I'm doing my best and feeling like it's never good enough. Feeling like I'm failing all the time. </s> <s> I'm working on that but I feel guilty wanting time to myself to do things	I think that's a systemic problem. Guilt is this powerful check when we do things that are wrong but self love is not wrong. When you constantly take care of others, you might forget to take care of yourself. We are only able to give the best version of ourselves when we feel validated. Perhaps there is a daycare or at home assistance program that will help give you the time to remember how great you are! Do you have some friends or close relatives that can talk with?
yes, my aunt pass away a couple weeks ago </s> <s> and since then im feeling really sad	It is natural to feel sad when someone you care about dies.
yes, my aunt pass away a couple weeks ago </s> <s> No, I live alone, my family lives in another state	Being by yourself is rough after a death.    Can you talk with your family by phone?   Do you have a friend who has gone through a similar loss?
I feel like everybody is in their own bussines and have no time to hear my complains </s> <s> I talk to my family, but the whole family is not doing really fine	It sounds like you feel people think you are complaining when you talk about your Aunt's death making you sad.    Is that correct?

I feel like everybody is in their own bussines and have no time to hear my complains </s> <s> Can you recommend someting for me to do to feel better?	"My own experiences with family deaths is they are sad.    I just wanted to ""feel better"".    My experience was it did not help to complain about ""being sad"" but it did help to talk about why I missed my family member.     If no one was available,   sometimes I would journal.   Do you think that might help you?"
Thnak you, I think it helps to have someone to chat </s> <s> Makes me feel better to chat a bit with you, helped me to relax	That is why I am here.     Is there anything else you would like to chat about?

Keeping busy and planning for the future better times are great ways to help overcome some of your sadness.

I believe she feels like she has finally gotten what she was yearning for after four years of Trumps administration and now she is elated that her candidate has finally won right? </s> <s> I guess I should just let her have her day?	well, let me ask you something. You've told me that you have been friends with her for a long time meaning that you understand her inside out right?

Do you think you guys could reconcile your relationship? Is there any hope? Is she willing to work with you and work through her mistakes? </s> <s> i wished we could, i just cannot get it of my mind	It takes time. Sometimes, the best relationships occur when people work through the most difficult occurrences in their relationship. Have you tried talking to her? I would recommend talking to her when your emotions have settled.

If there are a lot of pros, I think it's worth a shot! Just give yourself time to process everything that has happened. You don't want to sit down and talk to her and let all your emotions come out. That could cause more harm. Just make a list and you'll have a better understanding of which direction you should go with your relationship!
guessed you right, i just don't know if i can trust her, I don't think i can heal from the betrayer </s> <s> i understand, its just hard to trust when the trust is broken, hard to know what direction to turn to, forgive her or move on, to choose is just a hard decision.

I remember a time where learning crisis management that taking a deep breath and meditating in the positive work that you are doing can open up your mind to suggestions from your inner self. Have you ever thought that you superb skills can transmit in your home as well? </s> <s> Getting to that mindsight is challenging when the overwhelming feelings of 'failure' loom so heavily. I was seeing a therapist and making great strides, then he informed me that he was moving to a private practice. I cannot afford his sliding scale, and I feel let down. It's just that when one thing starts to go wrong, other things follow. Most of the time I see myself as a positive person that can work through challenging situations, but like you said it's a tough time for everyone	So now that you understand that you have a awesome skill and that is being positive, build on this. What building blocks can you write down that has helped you pushed through the fire and keep it some where close to you to always give you piece of mind and reinforce your habits of pushing through the fire.

I try to stay active. I am about 6 months into remission from stage 4 HL (cancer) and it's been quite the emotional journey there. With that said, the mental and physical overhaul left quite a dent in my overall feelings about myself. I'm just now able to run again and in the past week I ran 2 5k's. To me, this was monumental and made me feel great. I'm also learning how to not overextend myself. I just keep hoping for continued improvement in all areas. The reinforcement is just that I can get through this, these feelings are only temporary.	I totally understand that you are not for writing things down to keep. Yet, you have gone through a alot of events in your life where other would have given up. The key is transmitting your successes regardless of the situations. COVID is not going anywhere and as a person who has beaten stage 4 cancer, it is scary to be living in these times. You are doing monumental things, never forget that because your feelings and stamina for living will bind everything together. Politics, is the dirtiest and no government can solve  and will solve the problems in the world.

I see. My problem right now is that due to the pandemic and having a lot of time to myself and getting restless, I tend to waste a lot of time doing other things, and procrastinating.

Well if you can get some concrete info such as from the CDC and John Hopkins showing case counts in your area.  Show them graphs so they can visually see the impact.

And I hope he is a better place. Have you ever lost someone close to you?	I lost my father when I was 19. That was pretty tough and it took me years to be OK with it. There are still days a decade later where I think about him and miss him.
That's a tough one. I personally still struggle with sleep for other reasons. Some things that can help is taking melatonin 30 minutes before bed. I have also had some luck with white noise machines or other soothing sound machines. The biggest thing is to not use your bedroom for anything but sleeping; so don't read a book or play on your phone in bed, you have to train your body that when you go to bed it is time to sleep. </s> <s> I have a strong attachment to my phone. Will be a tough one to try leaving it off while I try to get some sleep.	Having a bedtime routine is also another tip. Try to do the same thing every night before bed.

"Recently no one in my family is talking to me. I think they are mad I went back to taking alcohol.
I was depressed because I lost my job. </s> <s> Its been a few weeks since I lost my job but I never told anyone In my family."	My advice is to try to talk to your family and explain to them that you lost your job and are feeling down. While they may not accept it at first it is a good start to try to give them some context for why you are drinking.
Alcohol is a way of self medicating; some people find it helpful to talk to a doctor to get an actual prescription for a medication to help. I personally stopped drinking once my doctor found the correct medication for me. That allowed me to be happy without drinking. </s> <s> One more question, did you stop drinking alcohol completely or did you go about your consuption?	I have done both; I have gone periods of 6-12 months having nothing to drink and then when I could control it I would allow myself to have drinks on special occasions.

I believe you have to end the conversation as I am not able to. I am here to keep on talking too if you would like. </s> <s> Thank you once more. Bye	You are welcome. Have a nice day!

The best advice I can share from my experience as a new mom was find someone to give you breaks.   Whether that be a partner, a friend, a family member, or even a baby sitter if that's possible.

I'm a bit tired too to be honest!   Is there anything you'd like to talk about today?  I'm ready to listen :) </s> <s> I have been tired a lot lately, even when I sleep for 8 hours. I am not sure what to really do to help myself gain more energy and recover my sleeping schedule to normal.	I see.  Are you finding it hard to function on not enough sleep?

Yes, I had a bad sleeping schedule, when I would go to sleep around 2-3am. I now get around 8 hours of sleep but I feel like it isn't enough still. </s> <s> Would this relate to a health problem of not being active or maybe stress?	I used to be a night owl, going to bed early in the morning.  I reset my schedule very gradually.  I went to bed 15 minutes earlier, and set an alarm for 8 hours later.  I did that for 3 days, then I would ratchet it back another 15 minutes.   It was a gradual process and the only way I could fix it.

Affirmations are positive statements you think about yourself.

Do you think that could help you feel more positively about what those closest to you are saying so much with regards to looks? </s> <s> I could try. Do I need to say positive things about my looks or can they be about other stuff?	"Since you are stating that you are concerned about how you look, you should just find a few positive statements with regards to your looks you think about yourself and repeat them. So if you don't think you need to lose weight, you can say something like, ""I like my weight."" or ""I don't need to lose weight."" If you think you are beautiful or pretty, you can say ""I am beautiful."" My three affirmations I use for myself are: I am beautiful, smart, and funny. I say this over and over again until my anxiety has left me."

Hello. I am sad because my job is not rewarding. It is a dead-end job and I feel shameful anymore. I don't like talking about my job with anyone since it is so pointless. </s> <s> Hi Sharon. I'm Larry.	Hi Larry.  What sort of job do you do?
I have had jobs that seemed pointless as well.   I was a sales assistant in a store constantly waiting for customers, it was boring!  Just a paycheque with no fulfillment.  I found it depressing as well. </s> <s> Yes that is a very good summary of what is going on. And I am glad to see you can relate.

Are there other jobs available in your area that you could apply for that are more up your alley?

I see., yes that could be a risk for sure.have you spoken to your manager to see if there may be other opportunities in the manufacturing facility for you?   I bet they would rather retrain you for a different position than lose you.

It's a catch 22, too lazy to leave but due to feeling sad from being here I don't have the energy to try to leave.	Yes I can understand that.  Sadness and depresion can lead one to feel depleted and lacking motivation to make change.

I just feel worn out with everything I have to do. </s> <s> I don't know what else I can d to help my daughter.	I understand that you are feeling worn out and don't know what else you can do to help your child. Is there something specific going on or is it just life in general?
I don't know what else I can d to help my daughter. </s> <s> My daughter struggles with school work and memory. She learns differently and needs lots of support. I have contacted the school a number of times over the years but never really had any support or acknowledgement from them. I guess it's just an accumulation of things.	You have tried hard to help her and that is admirable. Don't beat yourself up and be proud of the things you have done for her.
That is great advice. She does climb and hasn't been able to climb or see her friends with everything closed. I think as she will be able to again soon may be that will help her to relax and get back into it. She does learn through repetition but has lacked enthusiasm especially in the last few months. </s> <s> She had heart  surgery as a baby so has actually had the vaccine herself as she's in the vulnerable category.  I think she ends up spending so long making aide memoires that she then leaves herself so little time to actually study.	I can imagine after having heart surgery as a baby she wants to live life to it's fullest extent and prioritizes making memories over school. Does she ever talk about what her plans are for after high-school? At some point she will have to connect the dots of having to get a job to be able to go out and have fun, and unfortunately doing OK in school comes with that. That or a vocational school to learn a trade (what I personally did).

I am glad you are feeling more positive. I was into cars so I went to vocational school to become an auto mechanic. After a couple years of that I realized I wasn't cut out for physical labor and went to college. But the knowledge from working on cars helped me understand things better at college since I had real world applications I could use it on.

I've became a better person since we've met.	You might try talking to him and seeing if he has any awareness of your unhappiness, of you discomfort with his pushing for marriage and children when you're not ready.
He is very respectful, committed, sweet and loving, but I just don't feel anything towards him anymore. </s> <s> I feel guilty to hurt his feelings and at the same time it pisses me off even more!	A good friend once told me that all normal, sane people feel guilt when ending a relationship when they're not happy. There is no pleasure in breaking someone's heart, especially when they haven't done anything really wrong.
How do I tell my boyfriend that I don't want to be him anymore???? How do I break up??? </s> <s> You're right. I should talk about it with him openly and tell him how I really feel.	It sounds like you're maybe not 100% certain you want to end things. That's where talking to him becomes important.

My friend's husband is spreading false rumors about me because my daughter moved up in soccer and theirs didn't.

I agree that he's jealous but his daughter isn't really that good - didn't make the school team either.  Should I talk to my friend alone first?"	It depends on the depth of the relationship between the three of you. How long have you all been friends?
Yes, coaches are a great resource for life's dilemmas. Perhaps another option would be to casually mention something to him in passing, like at one your daughters games as to avoid any big blowups or emotional exlosions. </s> <s> Oh that's a good idea - in public and not making a big deal about it - and before she moves teams and rumors get worse.	That is exactly right. Each person handles and avoids conflict differently and you have the important roll as leader in all of this.

I understand how hard this has been for you so perhaps simply ignoring the rumors will allow you to heal quicker, by simply being the bigger person. Because rumors are just rumors, after all. You and your daughter know the truth and that's all that matters.

Maybe he didn't intend to hurt you. Its not like he invited you over to tease you. It is true that he didn't keep his promise, and that's his fault.
"Well, my fiance and I ""sort of"" broke up recently. I moved out of our place and all, but we continued to see each other at least 3X per week. And we both said we're not 100% sure that we're ok with us being done for good. - We promised to tell each other if we start dating anyone. He said he wasn't interested in dating. Three days after that conversation, I come over unexpectedly to find him making dinner for a woman I've never seen before. Turns out it was his 3rd date with her. He met her on a dating app a week before our conversation about promising to tell each other if we start dating others. </s> <s> That's true. He didn't invite me over. I expected him to be at work that night. I was coming over to see our cats, which still all lived with him.

I wouldn't have come in had I known what I'd find inside."	"That would definitely add to the distress of the situation to have a weird surprise like that.

It's a long story to explain here, but at first he told me it was a first date... then he said it was a second date... then finally he said it was a third date. I had to figure out on my own that he met her through a dating app, which makes me feel extra icky because now I kind of feel like a stalker. (Don't worry, I didn't do anything illegal or immoral to figure this out at all. He left an easy breadcrumb trail for me to follow.... but it still feels gross that I felt compelled to research the situation because I could ""feel"" he was lying.)"	That's ok, you have a vested interest in this person. It is natural to be interested in such things.

From past I have learnt that, friendship should be very transparent. There should be any space for thank you and sorry. It should be straight forward.

Have you considered registering with employment agencies for temp work? </s> <s> It would be nice to have something reliable long term, but I have done temp work in the past.	Me too. It can be a bit soulless but it does pay the bills when you don't have anything else to do.
Working from home is not what people expected. Many have found themselves isolated. They miss the interaction of the office. How long have you bee working from home? </s> <s> For a full year--since March 2020, when the pandemic first started. I was working from home just 1 day per week prior to that, which I liked.

That might work.

By the way, if your company wants you to stay home, then it might help buy the equipment you need to be productive.
Have you and your co-workers talked to your boss about a hybrid schedule, maybe a couple days a week in the office? That might work. </s> <s> That's a good thought. My computer is set-up on a folding card table. (I tried finding a desk a while back, but there was a huge shortage since everyone suddenly had to buy them for themselves, kids, etc.). I hadn't thought of asking my company to buy me one. Plus a more comfy chair could improve my attitude.	I think if you talk to your co-workers, they'll have ideas for upgrading your workspace.
"I think if you talk to your co-workers, they'll have ideas for upgrading your workspace. </s> <s> That's a great idea.

You are going to have to lay it all on the line with her, but be prepared for her to not respond in the way that you want.  Sometimes we do the best we can, and it still doesn't change the situation.  Just know that her decision does not mean you are unworthy, it just means that she is not worthy of you - but someone else is and then it would be time to go and find them.

We have been together for last 2 years. </s> <s> Yes.. we had out ups and downs during the time..	It sounds like it might not have been the most healthy relationship while it was going on, but it can still really hurt when something like that ends.
Yes..  I recently broke up with my partner </s> <s> I did not see this was coming.. happened all on a sudden..	Oh no, being taken by surprise like that can't be pleasant at all.
I am extremely depressed after that.. </s> <s> No it was not.. now I am in depression and don't know how to get out of it.	I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have friends you can talk to? Spending time with friends can be a good distraction, and give you people to rant to who know you best.
No it was not.. now I am in depression and don't know how to get out of it. </s> <s> I cannot think of anyone I can share my feeling with...	It sounds like you're feeling pretty alone right now
No it was not.. now I am in depression and don't know how to get out of it. </s> <s> Yes, I am..	You could take the opportunity to try and take up a new hobby. I know it sounds dumb, but finding something to put your energy into could really help
You could take the opportunity to try and take up a new hobby. I know it sounds dumb, but finding something to put your energy into could really help </s> <s> I am into playing musical instruments.. you think I should pick that up again?	That sounds like a great idea! That's an awesome skill and sounds like it would be fun to get back into.
I play flute.. I guess I will start it again.. thanks for the suggestion. </s> <s> I hope so.. I feel better talking to you.. thanks again..	It was great talking to you too :)
I play flute.. I guess I will start it again.. thanks for the suggestion. </s> <s> Have a good day..	You too!
I hear you .. it can be very difficult dealing with other peoples' problems all day. Would you consider retraining for something else? </s> <s> I just feel like I'm in limbo. Just there. People complain all day about their problem. I have a therapist, but I think my therapist is burnt out too.	It's a vicious cycle isn't it!? What about looking for another profession that does not involve much retraining?
Are you in a financial position where you could take some time off, go travelling perhaps, and renew yourself? </s> <s> True. They might wonder how committed I am to them and to the profession if I go away for a while. I've thought about lightening my work load too.	Yes perhaps you could switch to part time? If you could afford it?
Well, I would hope that they would understand that even therapists have to have a private life. And I am sure they'd prefer you at the peak of your game and not burned out. </s> <s> Money not really the issue. I just worry that I'll keep burning out, just more slowly. Other therapists go through this as well.	Somewhere at the top of the chain there must a very weary therapist with no-one to talk to. Though I suppose that is where these bots come in :D
Are you in a financial position where you could take some time off, go travelling perhaps, and renew yourself? </s> <s> seriously though, I guess I could try part-time for a while and see how it goes.	lol. It's an interesting mental picture. I am glad you still have a sense of humour though
Yeah - try  and take up a new hobby with the extra time, maybe? </s> <s> Try to. Humor is a defense mechanism and coping mechanism. I have hobbies. They seem less fun because my job is less fun.	I am sorry to hear that. On another note, have you considered speakign to your GP? Perhaps medication might help.
I am sorry to hear that. On another note, have you considered speakign to your GP? Perhaps medication might help. </s> <s> My therapist recommended medication too, but I worry that it might impair my ability to do my job.	I have tried medication and I found it surprisingly helpful but everyone is different of course. There was no impairment though.
Yes  you do! Thank you for talking and you take care of yourself! </s> <s> Thanks for your advice and honesty. I feel better now.	I am glad to hear it :) Goodbye!
My friends won't hang out with me. I am alone all the time. </s> <s> Yes, but also just no one to hang out with. I am a loner.	You prefer it that way?
My friends won't hang out with me. I am alone all the time. </s> <s> No. I want to hang out with people.	I follow you.  It is hard to see people outside of usual social circles right now with the pandemic going on.  Out of curiosity tell me what you like doing with others?
My friends won't hang out with me. I am alone all the time. </s> <s> I like to talk with them, listen to their stories, just hang out have a good time.	I can understand that. I have not seem my own friends for almost a year because of COVID-19.  It felt isolated and lonely.
That all sounds great. I think I'll need to do more exercising. I do like reading so I'll do that too. </s> <s> Thank you for the suggestions! I appreciate it.	What would you say might be good exercise or reading goals for you?
Thank you for the suggestions! I appreciate it. </s> <s> Thank you! I feel better!	Whatever works for you. All the best and stay safe.

Keep yourself occupied on other things so you wouldn't have to think about her.  Just think that you're lucky that it ended now, and it would've been worse if you found out about the cheating even later.

If you need some help emotionally, find yourself a counselor to talk to. </s> <s> but its not easy to me tell it to my family members	I see.  Over time you'll definitely be able to get over it.  There are so many other women out there that are better than her.  She may have been the perfect woman for you at one point but you really should come to terms that she isn't the one for you anymore.
Just try to focus on your hobbies, and hang out with your close friends.  Keep yourself occupied on other things so you wouldn't have to think about her.

You can think about the good times you've had with her, but that's in the past now so you should be focused on the future instead.

Good for you. My friend died few years ago. And it's so difficult for me </s> <s> She was close to me	You mentioned that she died a while back.  Has something stirred up the sadness recently?
She was my good friend. Always take caring of me and I the same way. We lived close to each other so we always hang out </s> <s> she was like my sister	I can understand that.  My best friend died a few years ago and he was like my brother.  Still does feel empty not having him around.
She gave you a lot of meaning and filled your time fondly.  I am taking it that after she passed you probably felt empty and lately it has been getting worse? </s> <s> however it's so difficult for me	I take it that the loss was sudden and it was a shock to your system.    So how have you been managing the sadness and grief since it happened?
She was my good friend. Always take caring of me and I the same way. We lived close to each other so we always hang out </s> <s> trying little by little	It sounds like your family is being supportive of you and you have a network.  It seems to me that you really put a great deal of mental energy and fortitude into taking care of yourself. Is there anything else that could help you get thru this rough patch you can think of?
"I try going out with my family and friend. Avoiding things that we used to do together </s> <s> I don't know. Do you hav
e any ideas?"	I can think of a few.  Physical activity even walking really helps people who are feeling down.  But it does not work for everyone.  I also know there are grief support groups but I do not know if they are open with the pandemic and everything.  I also know that there are a lot of mental health services available for professional counselling if things are too much.  I also heard that having things to do to fill your schedule helps like work or small projects to fill the day up.  What do you think would work best for you?
Probably will be difficult to find one now. I'll try fill my schedule so I always have something to do. </s> <s> And my mind won't be thinking so much of my friend	What things to you like to do that would benefit you to fill your schedule?
Probably will be difficult to find one now. I'll try fill my schedule so I always have something to do. </s> <s> Exercise, watching, a movie, play games,	So you have a toolbox of things you can do to stay busy to get you through this.  You seem to have solved this problem for yourself. That is a strength right there.

yes i have someone but they are not ready to talk with me </s> <s> I know it, but people aroud me are angry because i lost my job	"That's unfair of them. 
You don't need to discuss the problem. Just chatting with someone can change your mood."

If I may suggest this, you can look into programs that help re-employ or support laid off workers in your country. </s> <s> I have looked into it, applied but have not been fortunate to get one yet	I completely understand, I would also feel anxious if I were in this situation. It's an honorable thing that you've taken the initiative and are working hard to support your family.
Currently i have no support apart from the meagre earnings of my wife </s> <s> Sure. I really need your support on how to manage the anxiety because despite constant reassurance from my wife, i still feel i am letting down my family as a man	If it makes you feel any better, there are a bunch of workshops that offer support, what little it may be. I'm not sure what country you are in, but I've seen some small organizations that give away grocery vouchers for those in need. Perhaps you could narrow your search to find those as well, if you haven't already
Alright, you might want to start by taking deep breaths, and remember that this will not be the end of it all </s> <s> How often do i need the breaths?	Of course, breathing is the body's most calming function, you dont need a set amount of breaths, but take the time to be aware of the action and the stillness around you
Sure. I really need your support on how to manage the anxiety because despite constant reassurance from my wife, i still feel i am letting down my family as a man </s> <s> Apart from deep breaths, what other ways can i use to manage my anxiety?	Spending time actively playing with your kids would help, along with morning exercise (but nothing too strenuous) if you choose to do so
Alright, you might want to start by taking deep breaths, and remember that this will not be the end of it all </s> <s> Wanna give it a try	I hope you do, positive attitude is the start to a healthy mind.

yoga is not only for women, and yes therapy like a shrink but you don't have to talk to anybody if you do yoga or meditating </s> <s> Oh, meditating by myself? I would need someone to help me learn.

I’m majoring in computer engineering. It’s really #%$& hard! Everyone else is way smarter than I am. </s> <s> It's kinda late to switch. I'm at the end of my third year. My parents keep bugging me about getting a job.	To be honest with you, I switched majors a lot in college. I eventually let go of what my family thought and pursued a career I would truly enjoy for myself.
It's kinda late to switch. I'm at the end of my third year. My parents keep bugging me about getting a job. </s> <s> I wish I were in your shoes! If I change majors now, I have to redo at least a year of school, maybe more. I don't think my parents want to pay for that.	Personally I took three years longer than it should to get my degree and accrued some debt because of it. Although I feel it is worth it now.
It's kinda late to switch. I'm at the end of my third year. My parents keep bugging me about getting a job. </s> <s> That's good to know. Maybe I can convince my parents to let me borrow some money.

I've thought a lot about my options. </s> <s> I've thought about take a leave of absence, switching majors, going to trade school, traveling abroad...	A lot of people I know benefited from talking to an advisor or counselor for some direction. Have you done that recently?
That's good to know. Maybe I can convince my parents to let me borrow some money. I don't want to be a computer engineer. </s> <s> I talked to the school counselor. They laid out some options. It's really about money and time. If those weren't concerns, I would switch in a heartbeat.	What about meeting with the counselor with your parents, since it seems they would need to support you financially over any extra time it might take?
A lot of people I know benefited from talking to an advisor or counselor for some direction. Have you done that recently? </s> <s> The counselor might help me with that.	It's been shown that healthy communication can help people listen and respond more considerately when things seem difficult at first.
I've thought about take a leave of absence, switching majors, going to trade school, traveling abroad... </s> <s> I hadn't thought of it that way. I'm so worried about schoolwork that I hadn't stepped back from the whole situation of school itself.

So it sounds like you lost your livelihood and your concerned of losing everything you have built.   It seems like you are lost on what to do now. </s> <s> been doing it long enough for it to be 2nd nature	So I also take it that not doing it now must feel like you lost part of yourself as well besides the financial risk.  Double whammy.
I used to work in IT and did it for 14 years </s> <s> thanks for the advice	IT right now is highly marketable line of work.  Given the need for networking and teleconferencing right now you are in demand.  And 14 years experience you probably have a competitive advantage in the job market.

If her behavior is getting to you like this, I definitely suggest you try to keep some distance from her as much as you can. </s> <s> Yeah, I realize she's quite selfish so confronting her wouldn't help.	What do you think you can do to minimize your contact with her?
